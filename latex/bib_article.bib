abstract = {Neural circuits are remarkably adaptable, providing animals with the ability to modify their behavior on the basis of experience. At the same time, they are extremely robust and maintain stability despite the changes associated with adaptation. This combination of adaptability and stability is difficult to achieve, and it provides a strong constraint on any models of plasticity in neural circuits. New evidence suggests that the effect of action potential timing on synaptic plasticity may be an important element in reconciling homeostasis with adaptability. In particular, spike-timing dependent plasticity can act as both an adaptive and a homeostatic mechanism, controlling overall firing rates and distributions of synaptic efficacies while making neurons selective for certain aspects of their inputs. It can also cause networks that initially represent the present state of a stimulus to predict its future state on the basis of experience, a theoretical result supported by experimental data in behaving rats.},

All these models produced very similar outputs to current injections, including tiny details of the complex firing pattern. These models were not completely isolated in the parameter space, but neither did they belong to a large continuum of good models that would exist if weak compensations between channels were sufficient. The parameter landscape of good models can best be described as a set of loosely connected hyperplanes. Our method is efficient in finding good models in this complex landscape.

We produced multiple different models that exhibit a triphasic pyloric rhythm over a range of temperatures and explored the dynamics of their currents and how they change with temperature. Temperature can produce smooth changes in the relative contributions of the currents to neural activity so that neurons and networks undergo graceful transitions in the mechanisms that give rise to their activity patterns. Moreover, responses of the models to deletions of a current can be different at high and low temperatures, indicating that even a well-defined genetic or pharmacological manipulation may produce qualitatively distinct effects depending on the temperature.},

The repetitive burst firing of TC neurons at delta frequencies (1–4 Hz) has been linked to the oscillations recorded during deep sleep and during episodes of absence seizures. To get insight into the biophysical properties that are the basis for intrinsic delta oscillations in these neurons, we performed a bifurcation analysis of a minimal conductance-based thalamocortical neuron model including only the IT channel and the sodium and potassium leak channels. This analysis unveils the dynamics of repetitive burst firing of TC neurons, and describes how the interplay between the amplifying variable mT and the recovering variable hT of the calcium channel IT is sufficient to generate low threshold oscillations in the delta band. We also explored the role of the hyperpolarization activated cationic current Ih in this reduced model and determine that, albeit not required, Ih amplifies and stabilizes the oscillation.},

Using patch-clamp recordings of TC neurons in brain slices from mice and a realistic conductance-based computational model, we characterized seven subthreshold ion currents of TC neurons and quantified their individual contributions to the total steady-state conductance at levels below tonic firing threshold. We then used the TC neuron model to show that the resting membrane potential results from the interplay of several inward and outward currents over a background provided by the potassium and sodium leak currents. The steady-state conductances of depolarizing Ih (hyperpolarization-activated cationic current), IT (low-threshold calcium current), and INaP (persistent sodium current) move the membrane potential away from the reversal potential of the leak conductances. This depolarization is counteracted in turn by the hyperpolarizing steady-state current of IA (fast transient A-type potassium current) and IKir (inwardly rectifying potassium current). Using the computational model, we have shown that single parameter variations compatible with physiological or pathological modulation promote burst firing periodicity. The balance between three amplifying variables (activation of IT, activation of INaP, and activation of IKir) and three recovering variables (inactivation of IT, activation of IA, and activation of Ih) determines the propensity, or lack thereof, of repetitive burst firing of TC neurons. We also have determined the specific roles that each of these variables have during the intrinsic oscillation. {\textcopyright} 2014 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {A mathematical model of midbrain dopamine neurons has been developed to understand the mechanisms underlying two types of calcium-dependent firing patterns that these cells exhibit in vitro. The first is the regular, pacemaker-like firing exhibited in a slice preparation, and the second is a burst firing pattern sometimes exhibited in the presence of apamin. Because both types of oscillations are blocked by nifedipine, we have focused on the slow calcium dynamics underlying these firing modes. The underlying oscillations in membrane potential are best observed when action potentials are blocked by the application of TTX. This converts the regular single-spike firing mode to a slow oscillatory potential (SOP) and apamin-induced bursting to a slow square-wave oscillation. We hypothesize that the SOP results from the interplay between the L-type calcium current (I(Ca,L)) and the apamin- sensitive calcium-activated potassium current (I(K,Ca,SK)). We further hypothesize that the square-wave oscillation results from the alternating voltage activation and calcium inactivation of I(Ca.L). Our model consists of two components: a Hodgkin-Huxley-type membrane model and a fluid compartment model. A material balance on Ca2+ is provided in the cytosolic fluid compartment, whereas calcium concentration is considered constant in the extracellular compartment. Model parameters were determined using both voltage-clamp and calcium-imaging data from the literature. In addition to modeling the SOP and square-wave oscillations in dopaminergic neurons, the model provides reasonable mimicry of the experimentally observed response of SOPs to TEA application and elongation of the plateau duration of the square- wave oscillations in response to calcium chelation.},

abstract = {Excessive burst firing in the dopamine-depleted basal ganglia correlates with severe motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease that are attenuated by high frequency electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Here we test the hypothesis that pathological bursts in dopamine-deprived basal ganglia are generated within the STN and transmitted to globus pallidus neurons. To answer this question we recorded excitatory synaptic currents and potentials from subthalamic and pallidal neurons in the basal ganglia slice (BGS) from dopamine-depleted mice while continuously blocking GABA A receptors. In control mice, a single electrical stimulus delivered to the internal capsule or the rostral pole of the STN evoked a short duration, small amplitude, monosynaptic EPSC in subthalamic neurons. In contrast, in the dopamine-depleted BGS, this monosynaptic EPSC was amplified and followed by a burst of polysynaptic EPSCs that eventually reverberated three to seven times, providing a long lasting response that gave rise to bursts of EPSCs and spikes in GP neurons. Repetitive (10-120 Hz) stimulation delivered to the STN in the dopamine-depleted BGS attenuated STN-evoked bursts of EPSCs in pallidal neurons after several minutes of stimulation but only high frequency (90-120 Hz) stimulation replaced them with small amplitude EPSCs at 20 Hz. We propose that the polysynaptic pathway within the STN amplifies subthalamic responses to incoming excitation in the dopamine-depleted basal ganglia, thereby transforming the STN into a burst generator and entraining pallidal neurons in pathogenic bursting activities. High frequency stimulation of the STN prevents the transmission of this pathological activity to globus pallidus and imposes a new glutamatergic synaptic noise on pallidal neurons. {\textcopyright} 2011 Ammari, Bioulac, Garcia and Hammond.},

abstract = {Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is a widespread plasticity mechanism in the nervous system. The simplest description of STDP only takes into account pairs of pre- and postsynaptic spikes, with potentiation of the synapse when a presynaptic spike precedes a postsynaptic spike and depression otherwise. In light of experiments that explored a variety of spike patterns, the pair-based STDP model has been augmented to account for multiple pre- and postsynaptic spike interactions. As a result, a number of different “multi-spike” STDP models have been proposed based on different experimental observations. The behavior of these models at the population level is crucial for understanding mechanisms of learning and memory. The challenging balance between the stability of a population of synapses and their competitive modification is well studied for pair-based models, but it has not yet been fully analyzed for multi-spike models. Here, we address this issue through numerical simulations of an integrate-and-fire model neuron with excitatory synapses subject to STDP described by three different proposed multi-spike models. We also analytically calculate average synaptic changes and fluctuations about these averages. Our results indicate that the different multi-spike models behave quite differently at the population level. Although each model can produce synaptic competition in certain parameter regions, none of them induces synaptic competition with its originally fitted parameters. The dichotomy between synaptic stability and Hebbian competition, which is well characterized for pair-based STDP models, persists in multi-spike models. However, anti-Hebbian competition can coexist with synaptic stability in some models. We propose that the collective behavior of synaptic plasticity models at the population level should be used as an additional guideline in applying phenomenological models based on observations of single synapses.},

abstract = {During natural slow-wave sleep (SWS) in nonanesthetized cats, silent (down) states alternate with active (up) states; the down states are absent during rapid-eye-movement sleep and waking. Oscillations ({\textless}1 Hz) in SWS and transformation to an activated awake state were investigated with intracellular recordings in vivo and with computational models of the corticothalamic system. Occasional summation of the miniature EPSPs during the hyperpolarized (silent) phase of SWS oscillation activated the persistent sodium current and depolarized the membrane of cortical pyramidal (PY) cells sufficiently for spike generation, In the model, this triggered the active phase, which was maintained by lateral PY-PY excitation and persistent sodium current. Progressive depression of the excitatory interconnections and activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ current led to termination of the 20-25 Hz activity after 500-1000 msec. Including thalamocortical (TC) and thalamic reticular neurons in the model increased the duration of the active epochs up to 1-1.5 sec and introduced waning spindle sequences. An increase in acetylcholine activity, which is associated with activated states, was modeled by the reduction in the K+ leak current in PY and TC cells and by a decrease in intracortical PY-PY synaptic conductances. These changes eliminated the hyperpolarizing phases of network activity and transformed cortical neurons to tonic firing at 15-20 Hz. During the transition from SWS to the activated state, the input resistance of cortical neurons gradually increased and, in a fully activated state, reached the same or even higher values as during silent phases of SWS oscillations. The model describes many essential features of SWS and activated states in the thalamocortical system as well as the transition between them.},

However, the mechanism of this process is not yet understood. Intrinsic firing patterns of STN neurons were examined in rat brain slices with intracellular and patch-clamp techniques. Almost half of the STN neurons that spontaneously discharged in the single-spike mode had the intrinsic property of switching to pure or mixed burst-firing mode when the membrane was hyperpolarized from −41.3 ± 1.0 mV (range, −35 to −50 mV; n = 15) to −51.0 ± 1.0 mV (range, −42 to −60 mV; n = 20). This switch was greatly facilitated by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors with 1S,3R-ACPD. Recurrent membrane oscillations underlying burst-firing mode were endogenous and Ca2+-dependent because they were largely reduced by nifedipine (3 $\mu$m), Ni2+ (40 $\mu$m), and BAPTA-AM (10–50 $\mu$m) at any potential tested, whereas TTX (1 $\mu$m) had no effect. In contrast, simultaneous application of TEA (1 mm) and apamin (0.2 $\mu$m) prolonged burst duration. Moreover, in response to intracellular stimulation at hyperpolarized potentials, a plateau potential with a voltage and ionic basis similar to those of spontaneous bursts was recorded in 82{\%} of the tested STN neurons, all of which displayed a low-threshold Ni2+-sensitive spike. We propose that recurrent membrane oscillations during bursts result from the sequential activation of T/R- and L-type Ca2+ currents, a Ca2+-activated inward current, and Ca2+-activated K+ currents.},

Autonomous oscillation of STN and GPe neurons underlies tonic activity and is important for synaptic integration, whereas abnormal low-frequency rhythmic bursting in the STN and GPe is characteristic of PD.

abstract = {Recently, compelling evidence has accumulated that links sleep to learning and memory. Sleep has been identified as a state that optimizes the consolidation of newly acquired information in memory. Consolidation is an active process that is presumed to rely on the covert reactivation and reorganization of newly encoded representations. Hippocampus-dependent memories benefit primarily from slow-wave sleep (SWS), whereas memories not depending on the hippocampus show greater gains over periods containing high amounts of rapid eye movement sleep. One way sleep does this is by establishing different patterns of neurotransmitters and neurohormone secretion between sleep stages. Another central role for consolidating memories is played by the slow oscillation, that is, the oscillating field potential change dominating SWS. The emergence of slow oscillations in neocortical networks depends on the prior use of these networks for encoding of information. Via efferent pathways, they synchronize the occurrence of sharp wave ripples accompanying memory reactivations in the hippocampus with thalamocortical spindle activity. Thus, hippocampal memories are fed back into neocortical networks at a time when these networks are depolarized and, because of concurrent spindle activity, can most sensitively react to these inputs with plastic changes underlying the formation of long-term memory representations.

abstract = {Functional neurosurgery in patients with movement disorders has provided a unique opportunity to record directly form the human basal ganglia (BG) and to thereby further our understanding of these 'dark basements of the mind.' Two possibilities exist: either single unit and local field potential (LFP) recordings can be made intra-operatively through microelectrodes, or LFPs may be recorded directly from the deep brain stimulation electrode in the peri-operative period. The LFPs so recorded in the BG of patients are pleomorphic, oscillatory, focal and the product of synchronised current changes in local neuronal elements. They are presently most simply classified by frequency into activities at {\textless}8, 8-30 and {\textgreater}60 Hz, although such a schema is unlikely to capture the full complexity of rhythmic synchronisation with respect to behavioural and disease dependency. The best characterised group of LFP oscillations is that at 8-30 Hz. This activity is prominent in the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus of Parkinsonian patients withdrawn from their dopaminergic medication. Dopaminergic treatments, behaviourally relevant stimuli and voluntary movement suppress it. The available evidence points to the 8-30 Hz activity being essentially antikinetic in character and inversely related to motor processing. Its exaggeration may therefore contribute to the bradykinesia of Parkinson's disease. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Their low threshold for activation combined with a rapid and transient calcium conductance generates low-threshold calcium potentials (LTCPs), upon the crest of which high frequency action potentials fire for a brief period. Experiments using simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and intracellular recordings demonstrate that neuronal burst-firing is a likely causative component in the generation of normal sleep patterns as well as some pathophysiological conditions, such as epileptic seizures. However, less is known as to how these neuronal bursts impact brain behavior, in particular network synchronization. In this review we summarize recent findings concerning the role of T-type calcium channels in burst-firing and discuss how they likely contribute to the generation of network synchrony. We further outline the function of burst-firing and network synchrony in terms of epileptic seizures.

How the regulation of a cortical E/I ratio is affected by sleep and the circadian rhythm however, remains to be established. Here we addressed this issue through the analyses of TMS-evoked responses recorded over a 29 h sleep deprivation protocol conducted in young and healthy volunteers. Spectral analyses of TMS-evoked responses in frontal cortex revealed non-linear changes in gamma band evoked oscillations, compatible with an influence of circadian timing on inhibitory interneuron activity. In silico inferences of cell-to-cell excitatory and inhibitory connectivity and GABA/Glutamate receptor time constant based on neural mass modeling within the Dynamic causal modeling framework, further suggested excitation/inhibition balance was under a strong circadian influence. These results indicate that circadian changes in EEG spectral properties, in measure of excitatory/inhibitory connectivity and in GABA/glutamate receptor function could support the maintenance of cognitive performance during a normal waking day, but also during overnight wakefulness. More generally, these findings demonstrate a slow daily regulation of cortical excitation/inhibition balance, which depends on circadian-timing and prior sleep-wake history.},

abstract = {In several types of neurons, firing is an intrinsic property produced by specific classes of ion channels. Low-voltage-activated T-type calcium channels (T-channels), which activate with small membrane depolarizations, can generate burst firing and pacemaker activity. Here we have investigated the specific contribution to neuronal excitability of cloned human T-channel subunits. Using HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with the human $\alpha$1G (Cav3.1), $\alpha$1H (Cav3.2) and $\alpha$1I (Cav3.3) subunits, we describe significant differences among these isotypes in their biophysical properties, which are highlighted in action potential clamp studies. Firing activities occurring in cerebellar Purkinje neurons and in thalamocortical relay neurons used as voltage clamp waveforms revealed that $\alpha$1G channels and, to a lesser extent, $\alpha$1H channels produced large and transient currents, while currents related to $\alpha$1G channels exhibited facilitation and produced a sustained calcium entry associated with the depolarizing after-potential interval. Using simulations of reticular and relay thalamic neuron activities, we show that $\alpha$1I currents contributed to sustained electrical activities, while $\alpha$1G and $\alpha$1H currents generated short burst firing. Modelling experiments with the NEURON model further revealed that the $\alpha$1G channel and $\alpha$1I channel parameters best accounted for T-channel activities described in thalamocortical relay neurons and in reticular neurons, respectively. Altogether, the data provide evidence for a role of $\alpha$1I channel in pacemaker activity and further demonstrate that each T-channel pore-forming subunit displays specific gating properties that account for its unique contribution to neuronal firing.},

abstract = {In unconscious status (e.g., deep sleep and anesthetic unconsciousness) where cognitive functions are not generated there is still a significant level of brain activity present. Indeed, the electrophysiology of the unconscious brain is characterized by well-defined thalamocortical rhythmicity. Here we address the ionic basis for such thalamocortical rhythms during unconsciousness. In particular, we address the role of CaV3.1 T-type Ca2+ channels, which are richly expressed in thalamic neurons. Toward this aim, we examined the electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes of mice lacking CaV3.1 channels (CaV3.1 knockout) during unconsciousness induced by ketamine or ethanol administration. Our findings indicate that CaV3.1 KO mice displayed attenuated low-frequency oscillations in thalamocortical loops, especially in the 1- to 4-Hz delta band, compared with control mice (CaV3.1 WT). Intriguingly, we also found that CaV3.1 KO mice exhibited augmented high-frequency oscillations during unconsciousness. In a behavioral measure of unconsciousness dynamics, CaV3.1 KO mice took longer to fall into the unconscious state than controls. In addition, such unconscious events had a shorter duration than those of control mice. The thalamocortical interaction level between mediodorsal thalamus and frontal cortex in CaV3.1 KO mice was significantly lower, especially for delta band oscillations, compared with that of CaV3.1 WT mice, during unconsciousness. These results suggest that the CaV3.1 channel is required for the generation of a given set of thalamocortical rhythms during unconsciousness. Further, that thalamocortical resonant neuronal activity supported by this channel is important for the control of vigilance states.},

abstract = {1. Calcium currents were recorded with whole‐cell voltage‐clamp procedures in relay neurones of the rat thalamus which had been acutely isolated by an enzymatic dissociation procedure. 2. Low‐threshold and high‐threshold Ca2+ currents were elicited by depolarizing voltage steps from holding potentials more negative than ‐60 mV. A transient current, analogous to the T‐current in sensory neurones, was activated at low threshold near ‐65 mV and was completely inactivating at command steps up to ‐35 mV. Voltage steps to more depolarized levels activated a high‐threshold current that inactivated slowly and incompletely during a 200 ms step depolarization. 3. The high‐threshold current contained both non‐inactivating and slowly inactivating components which were insensitive and sensitive to holding potential, respectively. 4. A ‘T‐type' current was prominent in relay neurones, in both absolute terms (350 pA peak current average) and in relation to high‐threshold currents. The average ratio of maximum transient to maximum sustained current was greater than 2. 5. T‐current could be modelled in a manner analogous to that employed for the fast Na+ current underlying action potential generation, using the m3h format. The rate of activation of T‐current was voltage dependent, with a time constant (tau m) varying between 8 and 2 ms at command potentials of ‐60 to ‐10 mV at 23 degrees C. The rate of inactivation was also voltage dependent, and the time constant tau h varied between 50 and 20 ms over the same voltage range. With command potentials more positive than ‐35 mV, the inactivation of Ca2+ current could no longer be fitted by a single exponential. 6. Steady‐state inactivation of T‐current could be well fitted by a Boltzman equation with slope factor of 6.3 and half‐inactivated voltage of ‐83.5 mV. 7. Recovery from inactivation of T‐current was not exponential. The major component of recovery (70‐80{\%} of total) was not very voltage sensitive at potentials more negative than ‐90 mV, with tau r of 251 ms at ‐92 mV and 23 degrees C, compared to 225 ms at ‐112 mV. A smaller, voltage‐sensitive component accounted for the remainder of recovery. 8. All kinetic properties, including rates of activation, inactivation, and recovery from inactivation, as well as the amplitude of T‐current, were temperature sensitive with Q10 (temperature coefficient) values of greater than 2.5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) {\textcopyright} 1989 The Physiological Society},

Different modes of interactions among the cells in this network underlie different states of consciousness, such as wakefulness and sleep. Interposed between the dorsal thalamus and cortex are the GABAergic neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), which play a pivotal role not only in switching between the awake and sleep states but also in sensory processing during the awake state. The visual, somatosensory, and auditory sectors of TRN share many of the same organizational features. Each of these sectors contains maps, which are related to its inputs and outputs, and organizational components called 'slabs.' It is proposed that, during wakefulness, TRN is crucially involved in resetting the activity levels in sensory nuclei of the dorsal thalamus, which allows the cortex to actively and periodically compare its ongoing sensory processing with the available sensory information.},

abstract = {Corticothalamic neurons provide massive input to the thalamus. This top-down projection may allow the cortex to regulate sensory processing by modulating the excitability of thalamic cells. Layer 6 corticothalamic neurons monosynaptically excite thalamocortical cells, but also indirectly inhibit them by driving inhibitory cells of the thalamic reticular nucleus. Whether corticothalamic activity generally suppresses or excites the thalamus remains unclear. Here we show that the corticothalamic influence is dynamic, with the excitatory-inhibitory balance shifting in an activity-dependent fashion. During low-frequencyactivity, corticothalamic effects are mainly suppressive, whereas higher-frequency activity (even a short bout of gamma frequency oscillations) converts the corticothalamic influence to enhancement. The mechanism of this switching depends on distinct forms of short-term synaptic plasticity across multiple corticothalamic circuit components. Our results reveal an activity-dependent mechanism by which corticothalamic neurons can bidirectionally switch the excitability and sensory throughput of the thalamus, possibly to meet changing behavioral demands. The thalamus regulates sensory throughput to the neocortex, but the neocortex is also a major source of input to the thalamus. Crandall etal. reveal the dynamic mechanisms of cortical control over thalamic gating, providing a fresh framework for understanding this top-down pathway.},

abstract = {The thalamic output during different behavioral states is strictly controlled by the firing modes of thalamocortical neurons. During sleep, their hyperpolarized membrane potential allows activation of the T-type calcium channels, promoting rhythmic high-frequency burst firing that reduces sensory information transfer. In contrast, in the waking state thalamic neurons mostly exhibit action potentials at low frequency (i.e., tonic firing), enabling the reliable transfer of incoming sensory inputs to cortex. Because of their nearly complete inactivation at the depolarized potentials that are experienced during the wake state, T-channels are not believed to modulate tonic action potential discharges. Here, we demonstrate using mice brain slices that activation of T-channels in thalamocortical neurons maintained in the depolarized/wake-like state is critical for the reliable expression of tonic firing, securing their excitability over changes in membrane potential that occur in the depolarized state. Our results establish a novel mechanism for the integration of sensory information by thalamocortical neurons and point to an unexpected role for T-channels in the early stage of information processing.

abstract = {Neocortical and thalamic neurons are involved in the genesis of generalized spike-and-wave (SW) epileptic seizures. The cellular mechanism of SW involves complex interactions between intrinsic neuronal firing properties and multiple types of synaptic receptors, but because of the complexity of these interactions the exact details of this mechanism are unclear. In this paper these types of interactions were investigated by using biophysical models of thalamic and cortical neurons. It is shown first that, because of the particular activation properties of GABA(B) receptor-mediated responses, simulated field potentials can display SW waveforms if cortical pyramidal cells and interneurons generate prolonged discharges in synchrony, without any other assumptions. Here the 'spike' component coincided with the synchronous firing, whereas the 'wave' component was generated mostly by slow GABA(B)-mediated K+ currents. Second, the model suggests that intact thalamic circuits can be forced into a {\~{}}3 Hz oscillatory mode by corticothalamic feedback. Here again, this property was attributable to the characteristics of GABA(B)-mediated inhibition. Third, in the thalamocortical system this property can lead to generalized {\~{}}3 Hz oscillations with SW field potentials. The oscillation consisted of a synchronous prolonged firing in all cell types, interleaved with a {\~{}}300 msec period of neuronal silence, similar to experimental observations during SW seizures. This model suggests that SW oscillations can arise from thalamocortical loops in which the corticothalamic feedback indirectly evokes GABA(B)-mediated inhibition in the thalamus. This mechanism is shown to be consistent with a number of different experimental models, and experiments are suggested to test its consistency.},

@article{Destexhe1996,
abstract = {1. A network model of thalamocortical (TC) and thalamic reticular (RE) neurons was developed based on electrophysiological measurements in ferret thalamic slices. Single-compartment TC and RE cells included voltage- and calcium-sensitive currents described by Hodgkin-Huxley type of kinetics. Synaptic currents were modeled by kinetic models of $\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5- methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA(A)) and GABA(B) receptors. 2. The model reproduced successfully the characteristics of spindle and slow bicuculline-induced oscillations observed in vitro. The characteristics of these two types of oscillations depended on both the intrinsic properties of TC and RE cells and their pattern of interconnectivity. 3. The oscillations were organized by the reciprocal recruitment between TC and RE cells, due to their mutual connectivity and bursting properties. TC cells elicited AMPA-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in RE cells, whereas RE cells elicited a mixture of GABA(A) and GABA(B) inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in TC cells. Because of the presence of a T current, sufficiently strong EPSPs could elicit a burst in RE cells, and TC cells could generate a rebound burst following GABAergic IPSPs. Under these conditions, interaction between the TC and RE cells produced sustained oscillations. 4. In the absence of spontaneous oscillation in any cell, the TC-RE network remained quiescent. Spindle oscillations with a frequency of 9-11 Hz could be initiated by stimulation of either TC or RE neurons. A few spontaneously oscillating TC neurons recruited the entire network model into a 'waxing-and-waning' oscillation. These 'initiator' cells could be an extremely small proportion of TC cells. 5. In intracellular recordings, TC cells display a reduced ability for burst firing after a sequence of bursts. The 'waning' phase of spindles was reproduced in the network model by assuming an activity- dependent upregulation of I(h) operating via a calcium-binding protein in TC cells, as shown previously in a two cell model. 6. Following the global suppression of GABA(A) inhibition, the disinhibited RE cells produced prolonged burst discharges that elicited strong GABA(B)-mediated currents in TC cells. The enhancement of slow IPSPs in TC cells was also due to cooperativity in the activation of GABA(B)-mediated current. These slow IPSPs recruited TC and RE cells into slower waxing-and-waning oscillations (3-4 Hz) that were even more highly synchronized. 7. Local axonal arborization of the TC to RE and RE to TC projections allowed oscillations to propagate through the network. An oscillation starting at a single focus induced a propagating wavefront as more cells were recruited progressively. The waning of the oscillation also propagated due to upregulation of I(h) in TC cells, leading to waves of spindle activity as observed in experiments. 8. The spatiotemporal properties of propagating waves in the model were highly dependent on the intrinsic properties of TC cells. The spatial pattern of spiking activity was markedly different for spindles compared with bicuculline-induced oscillations and depended on the rebound burst behavior of TC cells. The upregulation of I(h) produced a refractory period so that colliding spindle waves merged into a single oscillation and extinguished. Finally, reducing the I(h) conductance led to sustained oscillations. 9. Two key properties of cells in the thalamic network may account for the initiation, propagation, and termination of spindle oscillations, the activity-dependent upregulation of I(h) in TC cells, and the localized axonal projections between TC and RE cells. In addition, the model predicts that a nonlinear stimulus dependency of GABA(B) responses accounts for the genesis of prolonged synchronized discharges following block of GABA(A) receptors.},

Hodgkin-Huxley type kinetic models of ionic channels were derived from voltage- and current-clamp data from RE cells. Interactions between interconnected RE cells were simulated with the use of a kinetic model of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory synapses. 2. The intrinsic bursting properties of RE cells in the model were due to the presence of a low-threshold Ca2+ current and two Ca(2+)-activated currents. The properties of these model RE cells were compared with RE neurons recorded intracellularly in vivo in cats. 3. Model RE cells densely interconnected with GABAA synapses produced synchronous oscillations at a frequency close to that of spindles (7-14 Hz). Networks of RE neurons organized in a two-dimensional array with only proximal connectivity also exhibited synchronized oscillations in the spindle range. In addition, the proximally connected network showed periods of high and low synchronicity, giving rise to waxing and waning oscillations in the population of RE cells. 4. The spatiotemporal behavior of the network was investigated during waxing and waning oscillations. The waxing and waning emerged as an alternation between periods of desynchronized and synchronized activity, corresponding to periods of irregular and coherent spatial activity. During synchronized periods, the network displayed propagating coherent waves of synchronous activity that had a tendency to form spirals. 5. Networks of model RE neurons fully connected through GABAB synapses exhibited perfectly synchronous oscillations at lower frequencies (0.5-1 Hz), but two-dimensional networks with proximal GABAB connectivity failed to synchronize. 6. These simulations demonstrate that networks of model neurons that include the main intrinsic currents found in RE cells can generate waxing and waning oscillatory activity similar to the spindle rhythmicity observed in the isolated RE nucleus in vivo. The model reveals the interplay between the intrinsic rhythmic properties of RE cells and the fast synaptic interactions in organizing synchronized rhythmicity.},

abstract = {Early studies have shown that spindle oscillations are generated in the thalamus and are synchronized over wide cortical territories. More recent experiments have shown that this large-scale synchrony depends on the integrity of corticothalamic feedback. Previously proposed mechanisms emphasized exclusively intrathalamic mechanisms to generate the synchrony of these oscillations. In the present paper, we propose a cellular mechanism in which the synchrony is dependent of a mutual interaction between cortex and thalamus. This cellular mechanism is tested by computational models consisting of pyramidal cells, interneurons, thalamic reticular (RE) and thalamocortical (TC) relay cells, on the basis of voltage-clamp data on intrinsic currents and synaptic receptors present in the circuitry. The model suggests that corticothalamic feedback must operate on the thalamus mainly through excitation of GABAergic RE neurons, therefore recruiting relay cells essentially through inhibition and rebound. We provide experimental evidence for such dominant inhibition in the lateral posterior nucleus. In these conditions, the model shows that conical discharges optimally evoked thalamic oscillations. This feature is essential to the present cellular mechanism and is also consistently observed experimentally. The model further shows that, with this type of corticothalamic feedback, conical discharges recruited large areas of the thalamus because of the divergent cortex-to-RE and RE-to- TC axonal projections. Consequently, the thalamocortical network generated patterns of oscillations and synchrony similar to in vivo recordings. The model also emphasizes the important role of the modulation of the I(h) current by calcium in TC cells. This property conferred a relative refractoriness to the entire network, a feature also observed experimentally, as we show here. Further, the same property accounted for various spatiotemporal features of oscillations, such as systematic propagation after low-intensity cortical stimulation, local oscillations, and more generally, a high variability in the patterns of spontaneous oscillations, similar to in vivo recordings. We propose that the large-scale synchrony of spindle oscillations in vivo is the result of thalamocortical interactions in which the corticothalamic feedback acts predominantly through the RE nucleus. Several predictions are suggested to test the validity of this model.},

We have investigated the intrinsic properties of RE cells using computational models based on morphological and electrophysiological data. Simulations of a reconstructed RE cell were compared directly with recordings from the same cell to obtain precise values for the passive parameters. In a first series of experiments, the low- threshold calcium current (I(Ts)) was studied via voltage clamp in acutely dissociated RE cells that lack most of their dendrites. Simulations based on a cell with truncated dendrites and Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics reproduced these recordings with a relatively low density of I(Ts). In a second series of experiments, voltage-clamp recordings obtained in intact RE cells in slices showed a higher amplitude and slower kinetics of I(Ts). These properties could be reproduced from the reconstructed cell model assuming higher densities of I(Ts) in distal dendrites. In a third series of experiments, current-clamp recordings were obtained in RE cells in vivo. The marked differences with in vitro recordings could be reconciled by simulating synaptic bombardment in the dendrites of RE cells, but only if they contained high distal densities of I(Ts). In addition, simpler models with as few as three compartments could reproduce the same behavior assuming dendritic I(Ts). These models and experiments show how intrinsic bursting properties of RE cells, as recorded in vivo and in vitro, may be explained by dendritic calcium currents.},

abstract = {To investigate the basis of the fluctuating activity present in neocortical neurons in vivo, we have combined computational models with whole-cell recordings using the dynamic-clamp technique. A simplified 'point-conductance' model was used to represent the currents generated by thousands of stochastically releasing synapses. Synaptic activity was represented by two independent fast glutamatergic and GABAergic conductances described by stochastic random-walk processes. An advantage of this approach is that all the model parameters can be determined from voltage-clamp experiments. We show that the point-conductance model captures the amplitude and spectral characteristics of the synaptic conductances during background activity. To determine if it can recreate in vivo-like activity, we injected this point-conductance model into a single-compartment model, or in rat prefrontal cortical neurons in vitro using dynamic clamp. This procedure successfully recreated several properties of neurons intracellularly recorded in vivo, such as a depolarized membrane potential, the presence of high-amplitude membrane potential fluctuations, a low-input resistance and irregular spontaneous firing activity. In addition, the point-conductance model could simulate the enhancement of responsiveness due to background activity. We conclude that many of the characteristics of cortical neurons in vivo can be explained by fast glutamatergic and GABAergic conductances varying stochastically. {\textcopyright} 2001 IBRO.

Applied to the control of beta oscillations in the basal ganglia, the model shows the modulation of beta activity under the action of a transient depolarization, for instance a dopamine signal. The model predicts, by analogy to the thalamocortical circuit, a novel gating function by which the transfer of cortical spikes through the indirect pathway is blocked under the inhibitory drive preceding movement but briefly released at the onset of movement execution.},

The results are presented in the context of half-center oscillators, which are simple rhythmic circuits composed of two reciprocally connected inhibitory neuronal populations. Specifically, we focus on rhythms that rely on a particular excitability property, the postinhibitory rebound, an intrinsic cellular property that elicits transient membrane depolarization when released from hyperpolarization. Two distinct ionic currents can evoke this transient depolarization: a hyperpolarization-activated cation current and a low-threshold T-type calcium current. The presence of a slow activation is specific to the T-type calcium current and provides a slow positive feedback at the cellular level that is absent in the cation current. We show that this slow positive feedback is required to endow the network rhythm with physiological modulation and robustness properties. This study thereby identifies an essential cellular property to be retained at the network level in modeling network robustness and modulation.},

Opposite, natural sleep and anesthesia reduced [K+]e while increasing [Ca2+]e, [Mg2+]e, and [H+]e as well as the extracellular volume.

abstract = {Neuronal information processing is regulated by fast and localized fluctuations of brain states. Brain states reliably switch between distinct spatiotemporal signatures at a network scale even though they are composed of heterogeneous and variable rhythms at a cellular scale. We investigated the mechanisms of this network control in a conductance-based population model that reliably switches between active and oscillatory mean-fields. Robust control of the mean-field properties relies critically on a switchable negative intrinsic conductance at the cellular level. This conductance endows circuits with a shared cellular positive feedback that can switch population rhythms on and off at a cellular resolution. The switch is largely independent from other intrinsic neuronal properties, network size and synaptic connectivity. It is therefore compatible with the temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity induced by slower regulatory functions such as neuromodulation, synaptic plasticity and homeostasis. Strikingly, the required cellular mechanism is available in all cell types that possess T-type calcium channels but unavailable in computational models that neglect the slow kinetics of their activation.},

We illustrate those properties on the much studied architecture of a small network controlling both the pyloric and gastric rhythms of crabs.

abstract = {Fifty years ago, FitzHugh introduced a phase portrait that became famous for a twofold reason: it captured in a physiological way the qualitative behavior of Hodgkin-Huxley model and it revealed the power of simple dynamical models to unfold complex firing patterns. To date, in spite of the enormous progresses in qualitative and quantitative neural modeling, this phase portrait has remained a core picture of neuronal excitability. Yet, a major difference between the neurophysiology of 1961 and of 2011 is the recognition of the prominent role of calcium channels in firing mechanisms. We show that including this extra current in Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics leads to a revision of FitzHugh-Nagumo phase portrait that affects in a fundamental way the reduced modeling of neural excitability. The revisited model considerably enlarges the modeling power of the original one. In particular, it captures essential electrophysiological signatures that otherwise require non-physiological alteration or considerable complexification of the classical model. As a basic illustration, the new model is shown to highlight a core dynamical mechanism by which calcium channels control the two distinct firing modes of thalamocortical neurons. {\textcopyright} 2012 Drion et al.},

A first objective is to review the basic modeling principles of neurophysiology in which neurons are modeled as equivalent nonlinear electrical circuits that capture their excitable properties. The specific architecture of the models is key to the tractability of their analysis: in spite of their high-dimensional and nonlinear nature, the model properties can be understood in terms of few canonical positive and negative feedback motifs localized in distinct timescales. We use this insight to shed light on a key problem in experimental neurophysiology, the challenge of understanding the sensitivity of neuronal behaviors to underlying parameters in empirically-derived models. Finally, we show how sensitivity analysis of neuronal excitability relates to robustness and regulation of neuronal behaviors.},

abstract = {Firing rate is an important means of encoding information in the nervous system. To reliably encode a wide range of signals, neurons need to achieve a broad range of firing frequencies and to move smoothly between low and high firing rates. This can be achieved with specific ionic currents, such as A-type potassium currents, which can linearize the frequency-input current curve. By applying recently developed mathematical tools to a number of biophysical neuron models, we show how currents that are classically thought to permit low firing rates can paradoxically cause a jump to a high minimum firing rate when expressed at higher levels. Consequently, achieving and maintaining a low firing rate is surprisingly difficult and fragile in a biological context. This difficulty can be overcome via interactions between multiple currents, implying a need for ion channel degeneracy in the tuning of neuronal properties.},

abstract = {Thalamic neurons have been long assumed to fire in tonic mode during perceptive  states, and in burst mode during sleep and unconsciousness. However, recent evidence suggests that bursts may also be relevant in the encoding of sensory information. Here, we explore the neural code of such thalamic bursts. In order to assess whether the burst code is generic or whether it depends on the detailed properties of each bursting neuron, we analyzed two neuron models incorporating different levels of biological detail. One of the models contained no information of the biophysical processes entailed in spike generation, and described neuron activity at a phenomenological level. The second model represented the evolution of the individual ionic conductances involved in spiking and bursting, and required a large number of parameters. We analyzed the models' input selectivity using reverse correlation methods and information theory. We found that n-spike bursts from both models transmit information by modulating their spike count in response to changes to instantaneous input features, such as slope, phase, amplitude, etc. The stimulus feature that is most efficiently encoded by bursts, however, need not coincide with one of such classical features. We therefore searched for the optimal feature among all those that could be expressed as a linear transformation of the time-dependent input current. We found that bursting neurons transmitted 6 times more information about such more general features. The relevant events in the stimulus were located in a time window spanning {\~{}}100 ms before and {\~{}}20 ms after burst onset. Most importantly, the neural code employed by the simple and the biologically realistic models was largely the same, implying that the simple thalamic neuron model contains the essential ingredients that account for the computational properties of the thalamic burst code. Thus, our results suggest the n-spike burst code is a general property of thalamic neurons.},

abstract = {Study Objectives: Sleep slow-wave activity (SWA, electroencephalogram [EEG] power between 0.5 and 4.0 Hz) is homeostatically regulated, increasing with wakefulness and declining with sleep. Sleep SWA is thought to reflect sleep need, but the mechanisms of its homeostatic regulation remain unknown. Based on a recent hypothesis, we sought to determine whether a decrease in cortical synaptic strength can account for changes in sleep SWA. Design: A large-scale computer model of the sleeping thalamocortical system was used to reproduce in detail the cortical slow oscillations underlying EEG slow waves. Setting: N/A. Patients or Participants: N/A. Interventions: Simulated reductions in the strength of corticocortical synapses. Measurements and Results: Decreased synaptic strength led to (1) decreased single cell membrane potential oscillations and reduced network synchronization, (2) decreased rate of neural recruitment and decruitment, and (3) emergence of local clusters of synchronized activity. These changes were reflected in the local EEG as (1) decreased incidence of high-amplitude slow waves, (2) decreased wave slope, and (3) increased number of multipeak waves. Spectral analysis confirmed that these changes were associated with a decrease in SWA. Conclusions: A decrease in cortical synaptic strength is sufficient to account for changes in sleep SWA and is accompanied by characteristic changes in slow-wave parameters. Experimental results from rat cortical depth recordings and human high-density EEG show similar changes in slow-wave parameters with decreasing SWA, suggesting that the underlying mechanism may indeed be a net decrease in synaptic strength.},

abstract = {Effective connectivity between cortical areas decreases during slow wave sleep. This decline can be observed in the reduced interareal propagation of activity evoked either directly in cortex by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or by sensory stimulation. We present here a large-scale model of the thalamocortical system that is capable of reproducing these experimental observations. This model was constructed according to a large number of physiological and anatomical constraints and includes over 30,000 spiking neurons interconnected by more than 5 million synaptic connections and organized into three cortical areas. By simulating the different effects of arousal promoting neuromodulators, the model can produce a waking or a slow wave sleep-like mode. In this work, we also seek to explain why intercortical signal transmission decreases in slow wave sleep. The traditional explanation for reduced brain responses during this state, a thalamic gate, cannot account for the reduced propagation between cortical areas. Therefore we propose that a cortical gate is responsible for this diminished intercortical propagation. We used our model to test three candidate mechanisms that might produce a cortical gate during slow wave sleep: a propensity to enter a local down state following perturbation, which blocks the propagation of activity to other areas, increases in potassium channel conductance that reduce neuronal responsiveness, and a shift in the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition toward inhibition, which decreases network responses to perturbation. Of these mechanisms, we find that only a shift in the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition can account for the observed in vivo response to direct cortical perturbation as well as many features of spontaneous sleep.

abstract = {Sleep spindles are burst-like signals in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of the sleeping mammalian brain and electrical surface correlates of neuronal oscillations in thalamus. As one of the most inheritable sleep EEG signatures, sleep spindles probably reflect the strength and malleability of thalamocortical circuits that underlie individual cognitive profiles. We review the characteristics, organization, regulation and origins of sleep spindles and their implication in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) and its functions, focusing on human and rodent. Spatially, sleep spindle-related neuronal activity appears on scales ranging from small thalamic circuits to functional cortical areas, and generates a cortical state favoring intracortical plasticity while limiting cortical output. Temporally, sleep spindles are discrete events, part of a continuous power band, and elements grouped on an infraslow time scale over which NREMS alternates between continuity and fragility. We synthetize diverse and seemingly unlinked functions of sleep spindles for sleep architecture, sensory processing, synaptic plasticity, memory formation and cognitive abilities into a unifying sleep spindle concept, according to which sleep spindles a) generate neural conditions of large-scale functional connectivity and plasticity that outlast their appearance as discrete EEG events, b) appear preferentially in thalamic circuits engaged in learning and attention-based experience during wakefulness c) enable a selective re-activation and routing of wake-instated neuronal traces between brain areas such as hippocampus and cortex. Their fine spatiotemporal organization reflects NREMS as a physiological state coordinated over brain and body and may indicate, if not anticipate and ultimately differentiate, pathologies in sleep and neurodevelopmental, -degenerative and -psychiatric conditions.},

Such currents have the ability to make the total conductance of the circuit negative in a timescale that is termed “slow” because it is intermediate between the fast timescale of the spike upstroke and the ultraslow timescale of even slower adaptation currents. We discuss how such currents can be assessed either in voltage-clamp experiments or in computational models. We show that, while frequent in the literature, mathematical and computational models of bursting that lack the slow negative conductance are fragile and rigid. Our results suggest that modeling the slow negative conductance of cellular models is important when studying the neuromodulation of rhythmic circuits at any broader scale. NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY Nervous system functions rely on the modulation of neuronal activity between different rhythmic patterns. The mechanisms of this modulation are still poorly understood. Using computational modeling, we show the critical role of currents that provide slow negative conductance, distinct from the fast negative conductance necessary for spike generation. The significance of the slow negative conductance for neuromodulation is often overlooked, leading to computational models that are rigid and fragile.},

Geometrically, the condition imposes a transcritical bifurcation that rules the switch of excitability through the variation of a single physiological parameter.

We have examined the underlying mechanisms using whole-cell recordings from rat $\alpha$1I stably expressed in HEK293 cells. We found several kinetic differences between $\alpha$1G and $\alpha$1I, including some properties that at first appear qualitatively different. Notably, $\alpha$1I tail currents require two or even three exponentials, whereas $\alpha$1G tails were well described by a single exponential over a wide voltage range. Also, closed-state inactivation is more significant for $\alpha$1I, even for relatively strong depolarizations. Despite these differences, gating of $\alpha$1I can be described by the same kinetic scheme used for $\alpha$1G, where voltage sensor movement is allosterically coupled to inactivation. Nearly all of the rate constants in the model are 5-12-fold slower for $\alpha$1I, but the microscopic rate for channel closing is fourfold faster. This suggests that T-channels share a common gating mechanism, but with considerable quantitative variability.},

abstract = {I propose that synchronization affects communication between neuronal groups. Gamma-band (30-90 Hz) synchronization modulates excitation rapidly enough that it escapes the following inhibition and activates postsynaptic neurons effectively. Synchronization also ensures that a presynaptic activation pattern arrives at postsynaptic neurons in a temporally coordinated manner. At a postsynaptic neuron, multiple presynaptic groups converge, e.g., representing different stimuli. If a stimulus is selected by attention, its neuronal representation shows stronger and higher-frequency gamma-band synchronization. Thereby, the attended stimulus representation selectively entrains postsynaptic neurons. The entrainment creates sequences of short excitation and longer inhibition that are coordinated between pre- and postsynaptic groups to transmit the attended representation and shut out competing inputs. The predominantly bottom-up-directed gamma-band influences are controlled by predominantly top-down-directed alpha-beta-band (8-20 Hz) influences. Attention itself samples stimuli at a 7-8 Hz theta rhythm. Thus, several rhythms and their interplay render neuronal communication effective, precise, and selective.},

abstract = {Memory is often defined as the mental capacity of retaining information about facts, events, procedures and more generally about any type of previous experience. Memories are remembered as long as they influence our thoughts, feelings, and behavior at the present time. Memory is also one of the fundamental components of learning, our ability to acquire any type of knowledge or skills. In the brain it is not easy to identify the physical substrate of memory. Basically, any long-lasting alteration of a biochemical process can be considered a form of memory, although some of these alterations last only a few milliseconds, and most of them, if taken individually, cannot influence our behavior. However, if we want to understand memory, we need to keep in mind that memory is not a unitary phenomenon, and it certainly involves several distinct mechanisms that operate at different spatial and temporal levels. One of the goals of theoretical neuroscience is to try to understand how these processes are orchestrated to store memories rapidly and preserve them over a lifetime. Theorists have mostly focused on synaptic plasticity, as it is one of the most studied memory mechanisms in experimental neuroscience and it is known to be highly effective in training artificial neural networks to perform real world tasks. Some of the synaptic plasticity models are purely phenomenological, some others have been designed to solve computational problems. In this article I will review some of these models and I will try to identify computational principles that underlie memory storage and preservation.},

Short memory lifetimes arise from the bounds that must be imposed on synaptic efficacy in any realistic model. We explored whether memory performance can be improved by allowing synapses to traverse a large number of states before reaching their bounds, or by changing the way these bounds are imposed. In the case of hard bounds, memory lifetimes grow proportional to the square of the number of synaptic states, but only if potentiation and depression are precisely balanced. Improved performance can be obtained without fine tuning by imposing soft bounds, but this improvement is only linear with respect to the number of synaptic states. We explored several other possibilities and conclude that improving memory performance requires a more radical modification of the standard model of memory storage. {\textcopyright} 2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

Most of the earlier studies focused on recordings in rodents and primates. More recently, significant advances have been made in this field of research through the analysis of basal ganglia field potentials recorded from implanted deep brain stimulation electrodes in the basal ganglia of human patients with Parkinson's disease and other disorders. It now appears that oscillatory activity may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. The most significant finding is that in Parkinson's disease synchronized oscillatory activity in the 10- to 35-Hz band (often termed $\beta$-band") is prevalent in the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits, and that such activity can be reduced by dopaminergic treatments. The entrainment of large portions of these circuits may disrupt information processing in them and may lead to parkinsonian akinesia (and perhaps tremor). Although less firmly established than the role of oscillations in movement disorders, oscillatory activities at higher frequencies may also be a component of normal basal ganglia physiology. {\textcopyright} 2006 Movement Disorder Society.},

abstract = {The elementary processing units in the brain are neurons (see Chapter 2) which are connected to each other via cable-like extensions, called axons and dendrites (see Chapter 3). The contact points between an axon terminal of a neuron A and the dendrite of another neuron B are called synapses. The most important synapses are chemical synapses, but there exist also electrical synapses which we will not consider further. When an action potential of neuron A arrives at the axon terminating at a chemical synapse, a chemical signal (neurotransmit-ter) is ejected into the synaptic cleft and taken up by receptors sitting on the membrane of the dendrite of the receiving neuron. Upon transmitter binding, an ion channel opens, ions flow into the cell and cause a change in the proper-ties of neuron B. This change can be measured as an Excitatory or Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP or IPSP) at the soma of the receiving neuron (see Chapter 3). The strength of an excitatory synaptic connection can be quantified by the amplitude of the EPSP. The most important insight for all the rest of chapter is that the strength of a synapse is not fixed, but can change.},

abstract = {A computational model of the rat subthalamic nucleus projection neuron is constructed using electrophysiological and morphological data and a restricted set of channel specifications. The model cell exhibits a wide range of electrophysiological behaviors characteristic of rat subthalamic neurons. It reveals that a key set of three channels play a primary role in distinguishing behaviors: a high-voltage-activated calcium channel (Cav1.2.-1.3), a low-voltage-activated calcium channel (Cav3.-), and a small current calcium-activated potassium channel (KCa2.1-2.3). Short and long posthyperpolarization rebound responses, low-frequency rhythmic bursting ({\textless}1 Hz), higher-frequency rhythmic bursting (4-7 Hz), and slow action and depolarizing potentials are behaviors all mediated by the interaction of these channels. This interaction can generate a robust calcium-dependent extended depolarization in the dendrites (a depolarizing plateau). The diversity observed in the rat subthalamic physiology (such as short or long rebounds, or the presence of low-frequency rhythmic busting) can arise from alterations in both the density and distributions of these channel types and, consequently, their ability to generate this depolarizing plateau. A number of important predictions arise from the model. For example, blocking or disrupting the low-voltage-activated Cav3.- calcium current should mute the emergence of rebound responses and rhythmic bursting. Conversely, increasing this channel current via large hyperpolarizing potentials in combination with partial blockade of the high-voltage-activated calcium channels should lead to the more experimentally elusive in vitro high-frequency bursting.

Kinetic differences are very pronounced only over the voltage range spanned by the g(Na)-voltage relation. At positive and negative extremes of voltage, activation and deactivation kinetics of I(Na) are practically indistinguishable in all species studied. Voltage-dependent rate constants underlying activation of the slow type of Na channel found in gastropods thus appear to be much more voltage dependent than are the equivalent rates in the universally fast type of channel that predominates in cephalopods. Voltage dependence of inactivation kinetics shows a similar pattern and is representative of activation kinetics for the two types of Na channels. Neurons with fast Na channels can thus make much more rapid adjustments in the number of open Na channels at physiologically relevant voltages than would be possible with only slow Na channels. This capability appears to be an adaptation that is highly evolved in cephalopods, which are well known for their high-speed swimming behaviors.

PIR can strongly influence the timing of spikes on rebound from an inhibitory input. We studied PIR in the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron of the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab Cancer borealis. The LP neuron is part of the pyloric network, a central pattern generator that normally oscillates with a period of ∼ 1 s. We used the dynamic clamp to create artificial rhythmic synaptic inputs of various periods and duty cycles in the LP neuron. Surprisingly, we found that the strength of PIR increased slowly over multiple cycles of synaptic input. Moreover, this increased excitability persisted for 10-20 s after the rhythmic inhibition was removed. These effects are considerably slower than the rhythmic activity typically observed in LP. Thus this slow postinhibitory rebound allows the neuron to adjust its level of excitability to the average level of inhibition over many cycles, and is another example of an intrinsic "short-term memory" mechanism.

abstract = {1. We address the hypothesis of Steriade and colleagues that the thalamic reticular nucleus (RE) is a pacemaker for thalamocortical spindle oscillations by developing and analyzing a model of a large population of all-to-all coupled inhibitory RE neurons. 2. Each RE neuron has three ionic currents: a low-threshold T-type Ca2+ current (ICa-T), a calcium-activated potassium current (IAHP) and a leakage current (IL). ICa-T underlies a cell's postinhibitory rebound properties, whereas IAHP hyperpolarizes the neuron after a burst. Each neuron, which is a conditional oscillator, is coupled to all other RE neurons via fast gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) and slow GABAB synapses. 3. For generating network oscillations IAHP may not be necessary. Synaptic inhibition can provide the hyperpolarization for deinactivating ICa-T that causes bursting if the reversal potentials for GABAA and GABAB synapses are sufficiently negative. 4. If model neurons display sufficiently powerful rebound excitability, an isolated RE network of such neurons oscillates with partial but typically not full synchrony. The neurons spontaneously segregate themselves into several macroscopic clusters. The neurons within a cluster follow the same time course, but the clusters oscillate differently from one another. In addition to activity patterns in which clusters burst sequentially (e.g., 2 or 3 clusters bursting alternately), a two-cluster state may occur with one cluster active and one quiescent. Because the neurons are all-to-all coupled, the cluster states do not have any spatial structure. 5. We have explored the sensitivity of such partially synchronized patterns to heterogeneity in cells' intrinsic properties and to simulated neuroelectric noise. Although either precludes precise clustering, modest levels of heterogeneity or noise lead to approximate clustering of active cells. The population-averaged voltage may oscillate almost regularly but individual cells burst at nearly every second cycle or less frequently. The active-quiescent state is not robust at all to heterogeneity or noise. Total asynchrony is observed when heterogeneity or noise is too large, e.g., even at 25{\%} heterogeneity for our reference set of parameter values. 6. The fast GABAA inhibition (with a reversal potential more negative than, say, -65 mV) favors the cluster states and prevents full synchrony. Our simulation results suggest two mechanisms that can fully synchronize the isolated RE network model. With GABAA removed or almost totally blocked, GABAB inhibition (because it is slow) can lead to full synchrony, which is partially robust to heterogeneity and noise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {1. The behavior of the mathematical model for the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG) developed in the previous paper was further studied. 2. The action of proctolin, a neuromodulatory peptide that acts directly on the LP neuron, was modeled. The effect of the proctolin-activated current (i(proc)) on the model neuron mimics the effects of proctolin on the isolated biological LP neuron. The depolarization and increased frequency of firing seen when i(proc) is activated are associated with changes in the relative contributions of the delayed rectifier (i(d)) and the Ca2+-activated outward current (i(o(Ca))) to the repolarization phase of the action potential. 3. The effects of turning off the A-current (i(A)) in the model were compared with those obtained by pharmacologically blocking i(A) in the biological neuron. i(A) appears to regulate action-potential frequency as well as postinhibitory rebound activity. 4. The role of i(A) on the rhythmic activity of the cell was studied by modifying several of its parameters while periodically activating a simulated synaptically activated conductance, i(syn). 5. The effects of manipulations of the maximal conductances (ḡ) for i(d) and i(o(Ca)) were studied. i(d) strongly influences action-potential frequency, whereas i(o(Ca)) strongly influences action-potential duration. 6. Modifications of the maximal conductance of the inward Ca2+ current (i(Ca)) were compared with the effects of blocking i(Ca) in the real cell. 7. The role of the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (i(h)) during ongoing rhythmic activity was assessed by periodically activating i(syn) while modifying i(h).},

If neuronal identity is associated with stereotypical function, as is the case in genetically identical neurons or in unambiguously identified individual neurons, this variability poses a conundrum: How is activity the same if the components that generate it - ionic current levels - are different? In some cases, ionic current variability across similar neurons generates an output gradient. However, many neurons produce very similar output activity, despite substantial variability in ionic conductances. It appears that, in many such cells, conductance levels of one ionic current vary in proportion to the conductance levels of another current. As a result, in a population of neurons, these conductances appear to be correlated. Here, I review theoretical and experimental work that suggests that neuronal ionic current correlation can reduce the global ionic current variability and can contribute to functional stability. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) 2014.},

Plasticity is also essential for the maintenance of stable patterns of activity in the face of variable environmental and internal conditions. Previous theoretical and experimental results suggest that neurons stabilize their activity by altering the number or characteristics of ion channels to regulate their intrinsic electrical properties. We present both experimental and modeling evidence to show that activity-dependent regulation of conductances, operating at the level of individual neurons, can also stabilize network activity. These results indicate that the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab can generate a characteristic rhythmic pattern of activity in two fundamentally different modes of operation. In one mode, the rhythm is strictly conditional on the presence of neuromodulatory afferents from adjacent ganglia. In the other, it is independent of neuromodulatory input but relies on newly developed intrinsic properties of the component neurons.},

abstract = {We investigated the synchronization dynamics of a coupled neuronal system composed of two identical Chay model neurons. The Chay model showed coexisting period-1 and period-2 bursting patterns as a parameter and initial values are varied. We simulated multiple periodic and chaotic bursting patterns with non-(NS), burst phase (BS), spike phase (SS), complete (CS), and lag synchronization states. When the coexisting behavior is near period-2 bursting, the transitions of synchronization states of the coupled system follows very complex transitions that begins with transitions between BS and SS, moves to transitions between CS and SS, and to CS. Most initial values lead to the CS state of period-2 bursting while only a few lead to the CS state of period-1 bursting. When the coexisting behavior is near period-1 bursting, the transitions begin with NS, move to transitions between SS and BS, to transitions between SS and CS, and then to CS. Most initial values lead to the CS state of period-1 bursting but a few lead to the CS state of period-2 bursting. The BS was identified as chaos synchronization. The patterns for NS and transitions between BS and SS are insensitive to initial values. The patterns for transitions between CS and SS and the CS state are sensitive to them. The number of spikes per burst of non-CS bursting increases with increasing coupling strength. These results not only reveal the initial value- and parameter-dependent synchronization transitions of coupled systems with coexisting behaviors, but also facilitate interpretation of various bursting patterns and synchronization transitions generated in the nervous system with weak coupling strength.},

In terms of numbers, the thalamic relay is dominated by synapses that modulate the relay functions. One of the roles of these modulatory pathways is to change the transfer of information through the thalamus, in accord with current attentional demands. Other roles remain to be explored.

We constructed a five-cell circuit in which a neuron is at the center of the circuit and the remaining neurons form two distinct oscillatory subnetworks. All neurons were modeled as modified Morris-Lecar models with a hyperpolarization-activated conductance (gh) in addition to calcium (gCa), potassium (gK), and leak conductances. We determined the effects of varying gCa, gK, and gh on the frequency, amplitude, and duty cycle of a single neuron oscillator. The frequency of the single neuron was highest when the gK and gh conductances were high and gCa was moderate whereas, in the traditional Morris-Lecar model, the highest frequencies occur when both gK and gCa are high. We randomly sampled parameter space to find 143 hub oscillators with nearly identical frequencies but with disparate maximal conductance, duty cycles, and burst amplitudes, and then embedded each of these hub neurons into networks with different sets of synaptic parameters. For one set of network parameters, circuit behavior was virtually identical regardless of the underlying conductances of the hub neuron. For a different set of network parameters, circuit behavior varied with the maximal conductances of the hub neuron. This demonstrates that neuromodulation of a single target neuron may dramatically alter the performance of an entire network when the network is in one state, but have almost no effect when the circuit is in a different state.},

abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthlamic nucleus (STN) represents an effective treatment for medically refractory Parkinson's disease; however, understanding of its effects on basal ganglia network activity remains limited. We constructed a computational model of the subthalamopallidal network, trained it to fit in vivo recordings from parkinsonian monkeys, and evaluated its response to STN DBS. The network model was created with synaptically connected single compartment biophysical models of STN and pallidal neurons, and stochastically defined inputs driven by cortical beta rhythms. A least mean square error training algorithm was developed to parameterize network connections and minimize error when compared to experimental spike and burst rates in the parkinsonian condition. The output of the trained network was then compared to experimental data not used in the training process. We found that reducing the influence of the cortical beta input on the model generated activity that agreed well with recordings from normal monkeys. Further, during STN DBS in the parkinsonian condition the simulations reproduced the reduction in GPi bursting found in existing experimental data. The model also provided the opportunity to greatly expand analysis of GPi bursting activity, generating three major predictions. First, its reduction was proportional to the volume of STN activated by DBS. Second, GPi bursting decreased in a stimulation frequency dependent manner, saturating at values consistent with clinically therapeutic DBS. And third, ablating STN neurons, reported to generate similar therapeutic outcomes as STN DBS, also reduced GPi bursting. Our theoretical analysis of stimulation induced network activity suggests that regularization of GPi firing is dependent on the volume of STN tissue activated and a threshold level of burst reduction may be necessary for therapeutic effect. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {GABAergic interneurons (INs) in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) shape  the information flow from retina to cortex, presumably by controlling the number of visually evoked spikes in geniculate thalamocortical (TC) neurons, and refining their receptive field. The INs exhibit a rich variety of firing patterns: Depolarizing current injections to the soma may induce tonic firing, periodic bursting or an initial burst followed by tonic spiking, sometimes with prominent spike-time adaptation. When released from hyperpolarization, some INs elicit rebound bursts, while others return more passively to the resting potential. A full mechanistic understanding that explains the function of the dLGN on the basis of neuronal morphology, physiology and circuitry is currently lacking. One way to approach such an understanding is by developing a detailed mathematical model of the involved cells and their interactions. Limitations of the previous models for the INs of the dLGN region prevent an accurate representation of the conceptual framework needed to understand the computational properties of this region. We here present a detailed compartmental model of INs using, for the first time, a morphological reconstruction and a set of active dendritic conductances constrained by experimental somatic recordings from INs under several different current-clamp conditions. The model makes a number of experimentally testable predictions about the role of specific mechanisms for the firing properties observed in these neurons. In addition to accounting for the significant features of all experimental traces, it quantitatively reproduces the experimental recordings of the action-potential- firing frequency as a function of injected current. We show how and why relative differences in conductance values, rather than differences in ion channel composition, could account for the distinct differences between the responses observed in two different neurons, suggesting that INs may be individually tuned to optimize network operation under different input conditions.},

abstract = {GABAergic interneurons (INs) in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) shape the information flow from retina to cortex, presumably by controlling the number of visually evoked spikes in geniculate thalamocortical (TC) neurons, and refining their receptive field. The INs exhibit a rich variety of firing patterns: Depolarizing current injections to the soma may induce tonic firing, periodic bursting or an initial burst followed by tonic spiking, sometimes with prominent spike-time adaptation. When released from hyperpolarization, some INs elicit rebound bursts, while others return more passively to the resting potential. A full mechanistic understanding that explains the function of the dLGN on the basis of neuronal morphology, physiology and circuitry is currently lacking. One way to approach such an understanding is by developing a detailed mathematical model of the involved cells and their interactions. Limitations of the previous models for the INs of the dLGN region prevent an accurate representation of the conceptual framework needed to understand the computational properties of this region. We here present a detailed compartmental model of INs using, for the first time, a morphological reconstruction and a set of active dendritic conductances constrained by experimental somatic recordings from INs under several different current-clamp conditions. The model makes a number of experimentally testable predictions about the role of specific mechanisms for the firing properties observed in these neurons. In addition to accounting for the significant features of all experimental traces, it quantitatively reproduces the experimental recordings of the action-potential- firing frequency as a function of injected current. We show how and why relative differences in conductance values, rather than differences in ion channel composition, could account for the distinct differences between the responses observed in two different neurons, suggesting that INs may be individually tuned to optimize network operation under different input conditions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Halnes et al.},

abstract = {According to a simple behavioral definition, sleep is a reversible behavioral state of perceptual disengagement from and unresponsiveness to the environment. Sleep is dividing into two states: Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep which is subdivided into three stages (N1, N2, N3); and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep characterized by rapid eye movements, muscle atonia and desynchronized EEG. Mammalian sleep and wake states are regulated by multiple neuronal systems located in the brainstem, diencephalon, and telencephalon. Wakefulness is maintained by activation of the ascending reticular activating system involving several neurotransmitters including glutamate, acetylcholine and the monoamines. NREM sleep onset is associated with a reduction in activation of the ascending reticular activating system and an increase in neural activity within the ventrolateral preoptic area, anterior hypothalamus and basal forebrain. REM sleep is triggered by activation of cholinergic neurons in the laterodorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei. The suppression of motor activity in REM sleep is generated by glutamate-mediated activation of descending medullary reticular formation. The two-process model postulates that a homeostatic process rises during waking and declines during sleep and interacts with a circadian process that is not directly dependent of sleep and waking. Sleep function remains controversial. Sleep is thought to be restorative, conservative, adaptive, thermoregulatory and memory consolidative functions. Sleep also serves host-defense mechanisms and conserves caloric expenditures. Emerging evidences indicated that sleep replenishes brain energy stores and that sleep serves a glymphatic function by removing toxic byproducts of waking activity. Finally, there is experimental evidence that connectivity changes with sleep, sleep loss, and with changing afferent input, and that those changes are linked to sleep regulatory mechanisms. Sleep medicine as a medical specialty has existed for more than 30 years. The study on over 90 kinds of sleep disorders has shed light on the understanding to the mechanisms of sleep. For example, the finding of the role of hypocretin/orexin in the patho-physiology of narcolepsy led to the reveal of hypocretin/orexin as a major wakefulness promoting substance. The evolution of the field will help us recognize the impact of sleep disorders on society as well as the nature of sleep itself.},

abstract = {Mammals have evolved a range of behavioural and neurological mechanisms that coordinate cycles of thermoregulation and sleep. Whether diurnal or nocturnal, sleep onset and a reduction in core temperature occur together. Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep episodes are also accompanied by core and brain cooling. Thermoregulatory behaviours, like nest building and curling up, accompany this circadian temperature decline in preparation for sleeping. This could be a matter of simply comfort as animals seek warmth to compensate for lower temperatures. However, in both humans and other mammals, direct skin warming can shorten sleep-latency and promote NREM sleep. We discuss the evidence that body cooling and sleep are more fundamentally connected and that thermoregulatory behaviours, prior to sleep, form warm microclimates that accelerate NREM directly through neuronal circuits. Paradoxically, this warmth might also induce vasodilation and body cooling. In this way, warmth seeking and nesting behaviour might enhance the circadian cycle by activating specific circuits that link NREM initiation to body cooling. We suggest that these circuits explain why NREM onset is most likely when core temperature is at its steepest rate of decline and why transitions to NREM are accompanied by a decrease in brain temperature. This connection may have implications for energy homeostasis and the function of sleep.},

After enzymatic isolation of LGN neurons from the same animals, the firing properties appeared well preserved, as indicated by whole-cell, current-clamp recordings from dissociated multipolar cells (presumably geniculocortical relay neurons). 2. Two types of Ca currents were identified in voltage-clamped, isolated LGN neurons on the basis of their voltage dependency, pharmacology, and selectively properties. These two currents resemble the low-voltage-activated (LVA) and high-volt-age-activated (HVA) Ca channels found in rat sensory neurons (9). 3. The LVA current component required negative potentials ({\textless}-80 mV) to deinactivate completely, started to activate around -60 mV and reached a plateau level around -25 mV. It peaked within 30-6 ms and decayed with a single time constant of {\~{}} 24 ms at -20 mV. Its inactivation curve ranged from -100 to -40 mV, with a half-inactivation near -60 mV. The HVA current component could be isolated by holding the membrane potential positive to -60 mV, activated at potentials positive to -30 mV and peaked around +5 mV. The time-to-peak ranged from 30 to 6 ms in the voltage range from -30 to +35 mV and decayed very slowly with sustained depolarizing pulses (time constant ranged between 1,600 and 40 ms over the same voltage range). 4.

The recovery from inactivation after short (100 ms), inactivating prepulses displayed two exponential phases. The slower phase was predominant under conditions that induce large current flow through the membrane, suggesting a Ca-mediated mechanism. 5. The LVA current was preferentially blocked by 50 $\mu$M Ni2+, leaving the HVA currents almost unaltered. Fifty micromolars Cd2+, in contrast, seemed more effective in blocking the HVA component of the Ca current.

Replacement of Ca2+ with Ba2+ reduced LVA currents and increased HVA currents, suggesting different selectivity of the two current components. 6. Confirmatory experiments in the slice preparation showed that Ni2+ abolished the LTS more effectively than Cd2+, supporting the idea that the LTS is the correlate of activation of LVA Ca current. In addition, the inactivation characteristics of the LTS in intact neurons matched the inactivation characteristics of the LVA Ca current in isolated cells. Further support was provided by current-clamp experiments in isolated cells that showed that a low-threshold, transient Ca spike and a high-threshold, prolonged Ca spike can be elicited under conditions that maximize LVA and HVA Ca currents. 7.

abstract = {1. To perform simulations of the various modes of action potential generation in  thalamic relay neurons, we developed Hodgkin-and-Huxley style mathematical equations that describe the voltage dependence and kinetics of activation and inactivation of four different currents, including the transient, low-voltage-activated Ca2+ current (IT), the rapidly inactivating transient K+ current (IA), the slowly inactivating K+ current (IK2), and the hyperpolarization-activated, mixed cationic current (Ih). The modeled currents were derived either from acutely dissociated rat thalamic relay neurons (IT, IA, IK2), or from guinea pig thalamic relay cells maintained in slices in vitro (Ih). 2. The voltage dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation of IT, IA, and IK2 and the activation of Ih could be modeled with Boltzmann-style equations. Modeling of the behavior of IT to depolarizing steps in voltage clamp required the use of the constant field equation to relate permeability to T-current amplitude. The time constant of activation of IT was described by a continuous bell-shaped function with a maximum near 15 ms at threshold for activation (-75 mV) and 23 degrees C. Mathematical description of the kinetics of inactivation and removal of inactivation of this current required two separate functions. 3. The rapidly activating and inactivating K+ current IA was modeled by assuming two components with different time constants of inactivation. The kinetics of activation was described as a continuous function of voltage with the slowest time constant, near 2.5 ms, at threshold for activation (-60 mV) and 23 degrees C. In contrast, the kinetics of inactivation of both components were described as voltage independent, consistent with experimental data. The rate or removal of inactivation of both components of IA was described as continuously increasing with the degree of hyperpolarization. 4. The slowly inactivating K+ current IK2 was also modeled by assuming two components with different rates of inactivation. The kinetics of activation were described by a bell-shaped function with a maximum time constant near 80 ms at -40 mV and 23 degrees C, whereas threshold for activation was approximately -60 mV. Inactivation of both components was modeled as relatively independent of voltage, whereas removal of inactivation was described as a continuous function of membrane potential. 5. The hyperpolarization-activation cationic current, Ih, was modeled by assuming that the current activates with a single exponential relation and does not inactivate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {The inhibitory GABAergic projection of thalamic nucleus reticularis (nRt) neurons onto thalamocortical relay cells (TCs) is important in generating the normal thalamocortical rhythmicity of slow wave sleep, and may be a key element in the production of abnormal rhythms associated with absence epilepsy. Both TCs and nRt cells can generate prominent Ca(2+)-dependent low-threshold spikes, which evoke bursts of Na(+)-dependent fast spikes, and are influential in rhythm generation. Substantial differences in the pattern of burst firing in TCs versus nRt neurons led us to hypothesize that there are distinct forms of transient Ca2+ current (I(T)) underlying burst discharges in these two cell types. Using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, we analyzed I(T) in acutely isolated TCs and nRt neurons and found three key differences in biophysical properties. (1) The transient Ca2+ current in nRt neurons inactivated much more slowly than I(T) in TCs. This slow current is thus termed I(Ts). (2) The rate of inactivation for I(Ts) was nearly voltage independent. (3) Whole-cell I(Ts) amplitude was increased when Ba2+ was substituted for Ca2+ as the charge carrier. In addition, activation kinetics were slower for I(Ts) and the activation range was depolarized compared to that for I(T). Other properties of I(Ts) and I(T) were similar, including steady-state inactivation and sensitivities to blockade by divalent cations, amiloride, and antiepileptic drugs. Our findings demonstrate that subtypes of transient Ca2+ current are present in two different classes of thalamic neurons. The properties of I(Ts) lead to generation of long-duration calcium-dependent spike bursts in nRt cells. The resultant prolonged periods of GABA release onto TCs would play a critical role in maintaining rhythmicity by inducing TC hyperpolarization and promoting generation of low-threshold calcium spikes within relay nuclei.},

The analysis and modeling of the voltage dependence, kinetics, and reversal potentials of these four currents, I(T), I(A), I(K2), and I(h), predict that I(T) should provide the inward current for the generation of low-threshold Ca2+ spikes, with the rapidly activating and inactivating K+ current I(A) modulating the initial components of these Ca2+ spikes. In contrast, the slower kinetics of activation and inactivation of the K+ current I(K2) suggest that this current may affect more the later portions of low-threshold Ca2+ spikes.

abstract = {Somatosensory thalamocortical (TC) neurons from the ventrobasal (VB) thalamus are central components in the flow of sensory information between the periphery and the cerebral cortex, and participate in the dynamic regulation of thalamocortical states including wakefulness and sleep. This property is reflected at the cellular level by the ability to generate action potentials in two distinct firing modes, called tonic firing and low-threshold bursting. Although the general properties of TC neurons are known, we still lack a detailed characterization of their morphological and electrical properties in the VB thalamus. The aim of this study was to build biophysically-detailed models of VB TC neurons explicitly constrained with experimental data from rats. We recorded the electrical activity of VB neurons (N = 49) and reconstructed morphologies in 3D (N = 50) by applying standardized protocols. After identifying distinct electrical types, we used a multi-objective optimization to fit single neuron electrical models (e-models), which yielded multiple solutions consistent with the experimental data. The models were tested for generalization using electrical stimuli and neuron morphologies not used during fitting. A local sensitivity analysis revealed that the e-models are robust to small parameter changes and that all the parameters were constrained by one or more features. The e-models, when tested in combination with different morphologies, showed that the electrical behavior is substantially preserved when changing dendritic structure and that the e-models were not overfit to a specific morphology. The models and their analysis show that automatic parameter search can be applied to capture complex firing behavior, such as co-existence of tonic firing and low-threshold bursting over a wide range of parameter sets and in combination with different neuron morphologies.},

abstract = {The understanding of the structural and dynamic complexity of mammalian brains is greatly facilitated by computer simulations. We present here a detailed large-scale thalamocortical model based on experimental measures in several mammalian species. The model spans three anatomical scales. (i) It is based on global (white-matter) thalamocortical anatomy obtained by means of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of a human brain. (ii) It includes multiple thalamic nuclei and six-layered cortical microcircuitry based on in vitro labeling and three-dimensional reconstruction of single neurons of cat visual cortex. (iii) It has 22 basic types of neurons with appropriate laminar distribution of their branching dendritic trees. The model simulates one million multicompartmental spiking neurons calibrated to reproduce known types of responses recorded in vitro in rats. It has almost half a billion synapses with appropriate receptor kinetics, short-term plasticity, and long-term dendritic spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (dendritic STDP). The model exhibits behavioral regimes of normal brain activity that were not explicitly built-in but emerged spontaneously as the result of interactions among anatomical and dynamic processes. We describe spontaneous activity, sensitivity to changes in individual neurons, emergence of waves and rhythms, and functional connectivity on different scales. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {The ionic requirements for electro-responsiveness in thalamic neurones were studied using in vitro slice preparations of the guinea-pig diencephalon. Analysis of the current-voltage relationship in these neurones revealed delayed and anomalous rectification. Substitution of Na+ with choline in the bath or addition of tetrodotoxin (TTX) abolished the fast spikes and the plateau potentials, described in the accompanying paper. Ca2+ conductance blockage with Co2+, Cd2+ or Mn2+, or replacement of Ca2+ by Mg2+ abolished the low-threshold spikes (l.t.s.). Substitution with Ba2+ did not significantly increase the duration of the l.t.s., suggesting that under normal conditions the falling phase of this response is brought about by inactivation of the Ca2+ conductance. The after-hyperpolarization (a.h.p.) following fast spikes was markedly reduced in amplitude and duration by bath application of Cd2+, Co2+ or Mn2+, indicating that a large component of this response is generated by a Ca2+-dependent K+ conductance (gK[Ca]). Following hyperpolarizing current pulses, the membrane potential showed a delayed return to base line. This delay is produced by a transient K+ conductance as it can be modified by changing the drive force for K+. Presumptive intra-dendritic recording demonstrated high-threshold Ca2+ spikes (h.t.s.s.) which activate a gK[Ca]. Such h.t.s.s. were also seen at the somatic level when K+ conductance was blocked with 4-aminopyridine. It is proposed that the intrinsic biophysical properties of thalamic neurones allow them to serve as relay systems and as single cell oscillators at two distinct frequencies, 9-10 and 5-6 Hz. These frequencies coincide with the alpha and theta rhythms of the e.e.g. and, in the latter case, with the frequency of Parkinson's tremor.},

abstract = {The electroresponsive properties of guinea‐pig thalamic neurones were studied using an in vitro slice preparation. A total of 650 cells were recorded intracellularly comprising all regions of the thalamus; of these 229 fulfilled our criterion for recording stability and were used as the data base for this report. The resting membrane potential for thirty‐four representative neurones which were analysed in detail was ‐64 +/‐ 5 mV (mean +/‐ S.D.), input resistance 42 +/‐ 18 M omega, and action potential amplitude 80 +/‐ 7 mV. Intracellular staining with horseradish peroxidase and Lucifer Yellow revealed that the recorded cells had different morphology. In some their axonal trajectory characterized them as thalamo‐cortical relay cells. Two main types of neuronal firing were observed. From a membrane potential negative to ‐60 mV, anti‐ or orthodromic and direct activation generated a single burst of spikes, consisting of a low‐threshold spike (l.t.s.) of low amplitude and a set of fast superimposed spikes. Tonic repetitive firing was observed if the neurones were activated from a more positive membrane potential; this was a constant finding in all but two of the cells which fulfilled the stability criteria. The l.t.s. response was totally inactivated at membrane potentials positive to ‐55 mV. As the membrane was hyperpolarized from this level the amplitude of the l.t.s. increased and became fully developed at potentials negative to ‐70 mV. This increase is due to a de‐inactivation of the ionic conductance generating this response. After activation the l.t.s. showed refractoriness for approximately 170 ms. Deinactivation of l.t.s. is a voltage‐ and time‐dependent process; full de‐inactivation after a step hyperpolarization to maximal l.t.s. amplitude (‐75 to ‐80 mV) requires 150‐180 ms. Membrane depolarization positive to ‐55 mV generated sudden sustained depolarizing 'plateau potentials', capable of supporting repetitive firing (each action potential being followed by a marked after‐hyperpolarization, a.h.p.). The a.h.p. and the plateau potential controlled the voltage trajectory during the interspike interval and, with the fast spike, constitute a functional state where the thalamic neurone displayed oscillatory properties. Frequency‐current (f‐I) plots from different initial levels of membrane potential were obtained by the application of square current pulses of long duration (2s). From resting membrane potential and from hyperpolarized levels a rather stereotyped onset firing rate was observed due to the presence of the l.t.s.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) {\textcopyright} 1984 The Physiological Society},

abstract = {Song is a learned vocal behavior influenced by social interactions. Prior work has suggested that the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), a specialized pallial-basal ganglia circuit critical for vocal plasticity, mediates the influence of social signals on song. Here, we investigate the signals the AFP sends to song motor areas and their dependence on social context by characterizing singing-related activity of single neurons in the AFP output nucleus LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium). We show that interaction with females causes marked, real-time changes in firing properties of individual LMAN neurons. When males sing to females ("directed"), LMAN neurons exhibit reliable firing of single spikes precisely locked to song. In contrast, when males sing alone ("undirected"), the same LMAN neurons exhibit prominent burst firing and trial-by-trial variability. Burst structure and timing vary substantially across repeated undirected trials. Despite context-dependent differences in firing statistics, the average pattern of song-locked firing for an individual neuron is similar across behavioral contexts, suggesting a common underlying signal. Different LMAN neurons in the same bird, however, exhibit distinct firing patterns, suggesting that subsets of neurons jointly encode song features. Together, our findings demonstrate that behavioral interactions reversibly transform the signaling mode of LMAN neurons. Such changes may contribute to rapid switching of motor activity between variable and precise states. More generally, our results suggest that pallial-basal ganglia circuits contribute to motor learning and production through multiple mechanisms: patterned signals could guide changes in motor output while state-dependent variability could subserve motor exploration.

abstract = {Contemporary brain research seeks to understand how cognition is reducible to neural activity. Crucially, much of this effort is guided by a scientific paradigm that views neural activity as essentially driven by external stimuli. In contrast, recent perspectives argue that this paradigm is by itself inadequate and that understanding patterns of activity intrinsic to the brain is needed to explain cognition. Yet, despite this critique, the stimulus-driven paradigm still dominates—possibly because a convincing alternative has not been clear. Here, we review a series of findings suggesting such an alternative. These findings indicate that neural activity in the hippocampus occurs in one of three brain states that have radically different anatomical, physiological, representational, and behavioral correlates, together implying different functional roles in cognition. This three-state framework also indicates that neural representations in the hippocampus follow a surprising pattern of organization at the timescale of ∼1 s or longer. Lastly, beyond the hippocampus, recent breakthroughs indicate three parallel states in the cortex, suggesting shared principles and brain-wide organization of intrinsic neural activity.},

abstract = {Thalamocortical and perigeniculate (PGN) neurons can generate action potentials either as Ca2+ spike-mediated high-frequency bursts or as tonic trains. Using dual intracellular recordings in vitro in monosynaptically connected pairs of PGN and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) neurons, we found that the functional effect of synaptic transmission between these cell types was strongly influenced by the membrane potential and hence the firing mode of both the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Activation of single action potentials or low-frequency spike trains in PGN or thalamocortical neurons resulted in the generation of PSPs that were 0.5-2.0 mV in amplitude. In contrast, the generation of Ca2+ spike-mediated bursts of action potentials in the presynaptic cell increased these PSPs to an average of 4.4 mV for the IPSP and 3.0 mV for the EPSP barrage, because of temporal summation and/or facilitation. If the postsynaptic neuron was at a resting membrane potential (e.g., - 65 mV), these PSP barrages could result in the activation of a low-threshold Ca2+ spike and burst of action potentials. These results demonstrate that the burst firing mode of action potential generation is a particularly effective means by which perigeniculate and thalamocortical neurons may influence one another. We propose that the activation of burst discharges in these cell types is essential for the generation of some forms of synchronized rhythmic oscillations of sleep and of epileptic seizures.},

abstract = {Long-term memory formation is a major function of sleep. Based on evidence from neurophysiological and behavioral studies mainly in humans and rodents, we consider the formation of long-term memory during sleep as an active systems consolidation process that is embedded in a process of global synaptic downscaling. Repeated neuronal replay of representations originating from the hippocampus during slow-wave sleep leads to a gradual transformation and integration of representations in neocortical networks. We highlight three features of this process: (i) hippocampal replay that, by capturing episodic memory aspects, drives consolidation of both hippocampus-dependent and non-hippocampus-dependent memory; (ii) brain oscillations hallmarking slow-wave and rapid-eye movement sleep that provide mechanisms for regulating both information flow across distant brain networks and local synaptic plasticity; and (iii) qualitative transformations of memories during systems consolidation resulting in abstracted, gist-like representations.},

abstract = {Sleep is known to support the consolidation of newly encoded and initially labile memories. Once consolidated, remote memories can return to a labile state upon reactivation and need to become reconsolidated in order to persist. Here we asked whether sleep also benefits the reconsolidation of remote memories after their reactivation and how reconsolidation during sleep compares to sleep-dependent consolidation processes. In three groups, participants were trained on a visuo-spatial learning task in the presence of a contextual odor. Participants in the ‘reconsolidation' group learned the task on day 1. On day 2, they were subjected to a reactivation procedure by presenting the odor cue and a mock recall test in the learning context before a 40-min sleep or wake period. Participants in the ‘remote consolidation' group followed the same procedure but did not receive reactivation on day 2. Participants in the ‘recent consolidation' group skipped the procedure on day 1 and learned the task immediately before the sleep or wake period. After the sleep or wake interval, memory stability was tested in all subjects. The results show that this short 40-min sleep period significantly facilitated the reconsolidation of reactivated memories, whereas the consolidation of non-reactivated remote memories was less affected and recently encoded memories did not benefit at all. These findings tentatively suggest that sleep has a beneficial effect on the reconsolidation of remote memories, acting at a faster rate than sleep-associated consolidation.},

Both similarities and marked differences are found between their biophysical properties. Currents induced by expression of $\alpha$1G show the fastest activation and inactivation kinetics. The $\alpha$1H and $\alpha$1I currents activate and inactivate up to 1.5- and 5-fold slower, respectively. No differences in the voltage dependence of steady state inactivation are detected. Currents induced by expression of $\alpha$1G and $\alpha$1H deactivate with time constants of up to 6ms at a test potential of -80mV, but currents induced by $\alpha$1I deactivate about three-fold faster. Recovery from short-term inactivation is more than three-fold slower for currents induced by $\alpha$1H and $\alpha$1I in comparison to $\alpha$1G. In contrast to these characteristics, reactivation after long-term inactivation was fastest for currents arising from expression of $\alpha$1I and slowest in cells expressing $\alpha$1H calcium channels. The calcium inward current induced by expression of $\alpha$1I is increased by positive prepulses while currents induced by $\alpha$1H and $\alpha$1G show little ({\textless}5{\%}) or no facilitation. The data thus provide a characteristic fingerprint of each channel's activity, which may allow correlation of the $\alpha$1G, $\alpha$1H and $\alpha$1I induced currents with their in vivo counterparts. {\textcopyright} European Neuroscience Association.},

To explore the mechanism for STN burst firing in this setting, we augmented a previously published conductance-based computational model for single rat STN neurons to include both DIC and NMDA currents, fit to data from published electrophysiological recordings. Simulations show that with these additions, the model engages in bursting activity at {\_}1 Hz in response to hyperpolarizing current injection and that this bursting exhibits several features observed experimentally in STN. Furthermore, a reduced model is used to show that the combination of NMDA and DIC currents, but not either alone, suffices to generate oscillations under hyperpolarizing current injection.

We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the region of the subthalamic nuclei of eight patients with Parkinson's disease during the performance of a warned reaction time task in which an imperative cue instructed the subject to move or not to move. In 'go' trials, LFP activity in the beta frequency band (∼20 Hz) decreased prior to movement, with an onset latency that strongly correlated with mean reaction time across patients. This was followed by a late post-movement increase in beta power. In contrast, in 'nogo' trials the beta power drop following imperative signals was prematurely terminated compared with go trials and reversed into an early beta power increase. These differences were manifest as power increases when go trials were subtracted from nogo trials. In six patients these relative beta power increases in nogo-go difference trials were of shorter latency than the respective reaction time. The findings suggest that, firstly, the subthalamic nucleus is involved in the preparation of externally paced voluntary movements in humans and, secondly, the degree of synchronization of subthalamic nucleus activity in the beta band may be an important determinant of whether motor programming and movement initiation is favoured or suppressed.},

The $\alpha$1I channels opened after small depolarizations of the membrane similar to $\alpha$1G and $\alpha$1H but at more depolarized potentials. The kinetics of activation and inactivation were dramatically slower, which allows the channel to act as a Ca2+ injector. In oocytes, the kinetics were even slower, suggesting that components of the expression system modulate its gating properties. Steady-state inactivation occurred at higher potentials than any of the other T channels, endowing the channel with a substantial window current. The $\alpha$1I channel could still be classified as T-type by virtue of its criss-crossing kinetics, its slow deactivation (tail current), and its small (11 pS) conductance in 110 mM Ba2+ solutions. Based on its brain distribution and novel gating properties, we suggest that $\alpha$1I plays important roles in determining the electroresponsiveness of neurons, and hence, may be a novel drug target.},

abstract = {Calcium-dependent inactivation of high voltage-activated Ca2+ channels plays a crucial role in limiting rises in intracellular calcium (Ca2+ i). A key mediator of these effects is calmodulin, which has been found to bind the C-terminus of the pore-forming a subunit. In contrast, little is known about how Ca2+ i can regulate low voltage-activated T-type Ca2+ channels.Using whole cell patch clamp, we examined the biophysical properties of Ca2+ current through the three T-type Ca2+ channel isoforms, Cav3.1, Cav3.2, or Cav3.3, comparing internal solutions containing 27 nMand lmMfree Ca2+. Both activation and inactivation kinetics of Cav3.3 current in l mM Ca2+ i solution were more rapid than those in 27 nM Ca2+ i solution. In addition, both activation and steady-state inactivation curves of Cav3.3were negatively shifted in the higherCa2+ i solution. In contrast, the biophysical properties of Cav3.1 and Cav3.2 isoforms were not significantly different between the two internal solutions. Overexpression of CaM1234 (a calmodulin mutant that doesn't bind Ca2+) occluded the effects of l mMCa2+ i on Cav3.3, implying that CaM is involved in the Ca2+ i regulation effects on Cav3.3. Yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a direct interaction of CaM with the carboxyl terminus of Cav3.3. Taken together, our results suggest that Cav3.3 T-type channel is potently regulated by Ca2+ i via interaction of Ca2+/CaM with the carboxyl terminus of Cav3.3.},

abstract = {Prolonged wakefulness alters cortical excitability, which is essential for proper brain function and cognition. However, besides prior wakefulness, brain function and cognition are also affected by circadian rhythmicity. Whether the regulation of cognition involves a circadian impact on cortical excitability is unknown. Here, we assessed cortical excitability from scalp electroencephalography (EEG) responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation in 22 participants during 29 h of wakefulness under constant conditions. Data reveal robust circadian dynamics of cortical excitability that are strongest in those individuals with highest endocrine markers of circadian amplitude. In addition, the time course of cortical excitability correlates with changes in EEG synchronization and cognitive performance. These results demonstrate that the crucial factor for cortical excitability, and basic brain function in general, is the balance between circadian rhythmicity and sleep need, rather than sleep homoeostasis alone. These findings have implications for clinical applications such as non-invasive brain stimulation in neurorehabilitation.},

We provide insights from experiments and computational work that show how state dependence can arise and the consequences it can have for cellular and circuit function.

conclu: First, modulators act
by altering parameters ofsingle neurons and synapses and, consequently, circuits. Second, synaptic and intrinsic membrane parameters themselves vary by organism. Third, howmembrane currents and synapses interact means that modulation can exhibit state dependence and nonlinearities. These principles are likely common to all nervous systems, from small to large.

It seems plausible that as the number of conductances in a model increases so does the likelihood that there will be some path that can connect models with the same behavior in a high-dimensional parameter space.

abstract = {1. A model of the electrophysiological properties of single thalamocortical relay neurons in the rodent and cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus was constructed, based in part on the voltage dependence and kinetics of ionic currents detailed with voltage-clamp techniques. The model made the simplifying assumption of a single uniform compartment and incorporated a fast and transient Na+ current, INa; a persistent, depolarization-activated Na+ current, INap; a low-threshold Ca2+ current, I(T); a high-threshold Ca2+ current, IL; a Ca(2+)-activated K+ current, IC; a transient and depolarization-activated K+ current, IA; a slowly inactivating and depolarization-activated K+ current, IK2; a hyperpolarization-activated cation current, Ih; and K+ and Na+ leak currents IKleak and INaleak. 2. The effects of the various ionic currents on the electrophysiological properties of thalamocortical relay neurons were initially investigated through examining the effect of each current individually on passive membrane responses. The two leak currents, IKleak and INaleak, determined in large part the resting membrane potential and the apparent input resistance of the model neuron. Addition of IA resulted in a delay in the response of the model cell to a depolarizing current pulse, whereas addition of IK2, or IL combined with IC, resulted in a marked and prolonged decrease in the response to depolarization. Addition of Ih resulted in a depolarizing "sag" in response to hyperpolarization, whereas addition of IT resulted in a large rebound Ca2+ spike after hyperpolarization.

abstract = {1. A model of the electrophysiological properties of single thalamocortical relay neurons in the rodent and cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus was constructed, based in part on the voltage dependence and kinetics of ionic currents detailed with voltage-clamp techniques. The model made the simplifying assumption of a single uniform compartment and incorporated a fast and transient Na+ current, I(Na); a persistent, depolarization- activated Na+ current, I(Nap); a low-threshold Ca2+ current, I(T); a high- threshold Ca2+ current, I(L); a Ca2+-activated K+ current, I(C); a transient and depolarization-activated K+ current, I(A); a slowly inactivating and depolarization-activated K+ current, I(K2); a hyperpolarization-activated cation current, I(h); and K+ and Na+ leak currents I(Kleak) and I(Naleak). 2. The effects of the various ionic currents on the electrophysiological properties of thalamocortical relay neurons were initially investigated through examining the effect of each current individually on passive membrane responses. The two leak currents, I(Kleak) and I(Naleak), determined in large part the resting membrane potential and the apparent input resistance of the model neuron. Addition of I(A) resulted in a delay in the response of the model cell to a depolarizing current pulse, whereas addition of I(K2), or I(L) combined with I(C), resulted in a marked and prolonged decrease in the response to depolarization. Addition of I(h) resulted in a depolarizing 'sag' in response to hyperpolarization, whereas addition of I(T) resulted in a large rebound Ca2+ spike after hyperpolarization. Finally, addition of I(Nap) resulted in enhancement of depolarization. 3. The low-threshold Ca2+ spike of rodent neurons was successfully modeled with the active currents I(T), I(L), I(A), I(C), and I(K2). The low-threshold Ca2+ current I(T) generated the low-threshold Ca2+ spike. The transient K+ current I(A) slowed the rate of rise and reduced the peak amplitude of the low-threshold Ca2+ spike, whereas the slowly inactivating K+ current I(K2) contributed greatly to the repolarization of the Ca2+ spike. Activation of I(L) during the peak of the Ca2+ spike led to activation of I(C), which also contributed to the repolarization of the Ca2+ spike. Reduction of any one of the K+ currents resulted in an increase in the other two, thereby resulting in substantially smaller changes in the Ca2+ spike than would be expected on the basis of the amplitude of each ionic current alone. 4. Activation of the various K+ currents, I(A), I(K2), and I(C), also resulted in apparent rectification of the model neuron such that the response to a depolarizing current pulse was substantially smaller than the response to a hyperpolarizing current pulse. 5. Fast, Na+-dependent action potentials were repolarized largely by I(C) at membrane potentials positive to -60 mV, with smaller contributions by I(A) and I(K2). In contrast, I(A) and I(K2) formed a major component of the ionic currents flowing in between action potentials and therefore slowed the rate of action potential generation.},

Spindle waves are generated largely through a cyclical interaction between thalamocortical and thalamic reticular neurons involving both the intrinsic membrane properties of these cells and their anatomical interconnections. Specific alterations in the interactions between these cells can result in the generation of paroxysmal events resembling absence seizures in children. The release of several different neurotran smitters from the brain stem, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, and cerebral cortex results in a depolarization of thalamocortical and thalamic reticular neurons and an enhanced excitability in many cortical pyramidal cells, thereby suppressing the generation of sleep rhythms and promoting a state that is conducive to sensory processing and cognition.},

The generation of rhythmic activity occurs through the interaction of stereotyped patterns of connectivity together with intrinsic membrane and synaptic properties. One common theme in the generation of rhythms is the interaction of a positive feedback loop (e.g., recurrent excitation) with negative feedback control (e.g., inhibition, adaptation, or synaptic depression). The operation of these state-dependent activities has wide ranging effects from enhancing or blocking sensory-motor processing to the generation of pathological rhythms associated with psychiatric or neurological disorders.},

These variations contribute to the apparent noisiness of sensory responses at both the neural and the behavioral level. Recent investigations of rapid state changes in awake, behaving animals have provided insight into the mechanisms by which optimal sensory encoding and behavioral performance are achieved. Fluctuations in state, as indexed by pupillometry, impact both the "signal" (sensory evoked response) and the "noise" (spontaneous activity) of cortical responses. By taking these fluctuations into account, neural response (co)variability is significantly reduced, revealing the brain to be more reliable and predictable than previously thought. The waking brain appears to be noisy, giving rise to variable responses. McGinley et al. review literature that reveals the careful monitoring of waking can control for these variations and reveal a brain that is both reliable and predictable.},

abstract = {Voltage-gated calcium channels represent a heterogenous family of calcium-selective channels that can be distinguished by their molecular, electrophysiological, and pharmacological characteristics. We report here the molecular cloning and functional expression of three members of the low voltage-activated calcium channel family from rat brain ($\alpha$1G, $\alpha$1H, and $\alpha$1I). Northern blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses show $\alpha$1G, $\alpha$1H, and $\alpha$1I to be expressed throughout the newborn and juvenile rat brain. In contrast, while $\alpha$1G and $\alpha$1H mRNA are expressed in all regions in adult rat brain, $\alpha$1I mRNA expression is restricted to the striatum. Expression of $\alpha$1G, $\alpha$1H, and $\alpha$1I subunits in HEK293 cells resulted in calcium currents with typical T-type channel characteristics: low voltage activation, negative steady-state inactivation, strongly voltage-dependent activation and inactivation, and slow deactivation. In addition, the direct electrophysiological comparison of $\alpha$1G, $\alpha$1H, and $\alpha$1I under identical recording conditions also identified unique characteristics including activation and inactivation kinetics and permeability to divalent cations. Simulation of $\alpha$1G, $\alpha$1H, and $\alpha$ 1I T-type channels in a thalamic neuron model cell produced unique firing patterns (burst versus tonic) typical of different brain nuclei and suggests that the three channel types make distinct contributions to neuronal physiology.},

However, there are robust correlations between different ion channel expression levels, although the mechanisms that determine these correlations are unknown. Using generic model neurons, we show that correlated conductance expression can emerge from simple homeostatic control mechanisms that couple expression rates of individual conductances to cellular readouts of activity. The correlations depend on the relative rates of expression of different conductances. Thus, variability is consistent with homeostatic regulation and the structure of this variability reveals quantitative relations between regulation dynamics of different conductances. Furthermore, we show that homeostatic regulation is remarkably insensitive to the details that couple the regulation of a given conductance to overall neuronal activity because of degeneracy in the function of multiple conductances and can be robust to "antihomeostatic" regulation of a subset of conductances expressed in a cell.},

abstract = {In this study, we developed a general description of parameter combinations for which specified characteristics of neuronal or network activity are constant. Our approach is based on the implicit function theorem and is applicable to activity characteristics that smoothly depend on parameters. Such smoothness is often intrinsic to neuronal systems when they are in stable functional states. The conclusions about how parameters compensate each other, developed in this study, can thus be used even without regard to the specific mathematical model describing a particular neuron or neuronal network. We showed that near a generic point in the parameter space there are infinitely many other points, or parameter combinations, for which specified characteristics of activity are the same as in the original point. These parameter combinations form a smooth manifold. This manifold can be extended as long as the gradients of characteristics are defined and independent. All possible variations of parameters compensating each other are simply all possible charts of the same manifold. The number of compensating parameters (but not parameters themselves) is fixed and equal to the number of the independent characteristics maintained. The algorithm that we developed shows how to find compensatory functional dependencies between parameters numerically. Our method can be used in the analysis of the homeostatic regulation, neuronal database search, model tuning and other applications.

abstract = {Because the subthalamic nucleus (STN) acts as a driving force of the basal ganglia, it is important to know how the activities of STN neurons are regulated. Previously, we have reported that a subset of STN neurons generates a plateau potential in a voltage-dependent manner. These plateau potentials can be evoked only when the cell is hyperpolarized. Here, to examine the mechanism of the voltage-dependent generation of the plateau potential in STN neurons, we constructed a conductance-based model of the plateau-generating STN neuron based on experimental observations and compared simulation results with recordings in slices. The model consists of a single compartment containing a Na+ current, a delayed-rectifier K+ current, an A-type K+ current, an L-like long-lasting Ca2+ current, a T-type Ca 2+ current, a Ca2+-dependent K+ current, and a leak current. Our simulation results showed that a plateau potential in the model could be induced in a voltage-dependent manner that depended on the inactivation properties of L-like long-lasting Ca2+ current. The model could also reproduce the generation of a plateau potential as a rebound potential after termination of hyperpolarizing current injection. In addition, we tested the stability of simulated plateau potentials against inhibitory perturbation and found that the model showed similar properties observed for the plateau potentials of STN neurons in slices. The effects of K+ channel blockade by TEA and intracellular Ca2+ ion chelation by BAPTA on the plateau duration were also tested in the model and were found to match experimental observations. Thus our STN neuron model could qualitatively reproduce a number of experimental observations on plateau potentials. Our results suggest that the inactivation of L-type Ca2+ channels plays an important role in the voltage-dependent generation of the plateau potential.},

Although all three channels are low voltage-activated, they display considerable differences in their kinetics, with Cav3.1 and Cav3.2 channels activating and inactivating much faster than Cav3.3 channels. The goal of the present study was to determine the structural elements that confer the distinctively slow kinetics of Cav3.3 channels. To address this question, a series of chimeric channels between Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 channels were constructed and expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Kinetic analysis showed that the slow activation and inactivation kinetics of the Cav3.3 channel were not completely abolished by substitution with any one portion of the Cav3.1 channel. Likewise, the Cav3.1 channel failed to acquire the slow kinetics by simply adopting one portion of the Cav3.3 channel. These findings suggest that multiple structural elements contribute to the slow kinetics of Cav3.3 channels.},

abstract = {Sleep and wakefulness are characterized by distinct states of thalamocortical network oscillations. The complex interplay of ionic conductances within the thalamo-reticular-cortical network give rise to these multiple modes of activity and a rapid transition exists between these modes. To better understand this transition, we constructed a simplified computational model based on physiological recordings and physiologically realistic parameters of a three-neuron network containing a thalamocortical cell, a thalamic reticular neuron, and a corticothalamic cell. The network can assume multiple states of oscillatory activity, resembling sleep, wakefulness, and the transition between these two. We found that during the transition period, but not during other states, thalamic and cortical neurons displayed chaotic dynamics, based on the presence of strange attractors, estimation of positive Lyapunov exponents and the presence of a fractal dimension in the spike trains. These dynamics were quantitatively dependent on certain features of the network, such as the presence of corticothalamic feedback and the strength of inhibition between the thalamic reticular nucleus and thalamocortical neurons. These data suggest that chaotic dynamics facilitate a rapid transition between sleep and wakefulness and produce a series of experimentally testable predictions to further investigate the events occurring during the sleep-wake transition period.},

abstract = {T-type Ca2+ channels were originally called low-voltage-activated (LVA) channels because they can be activated by small depolarizations of the plasma membrane. In many neurons Ca2+ influx through LVA channels triggers low-threshold spikes, which in turn triggers a burst of action potentials mediated by Na+ channels. Burst firing is thought to play an important role in the synchronized activity of the thalamus observed in absence epilepsy, but may also underlie a wider range of thalamocortical dysrhythmias. In addition to a pacemaker role, Ca2+ entry via T-type channels can directly regulate intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, which is an important second messenger for a variety of cellular processes. Molecular cloning revealed the existence of three T-type channel genes. The deduced amino acid sequence shows a similar four-repeat structure to that found in high-voltage-activated (HVA) Ca2+ channels, and Na+ channels, indicating that they are evolutionarily related. Hence, the $\alpha$1-subunits of T-type channels are now designated Cav3. Although mRNAs for all three Cav3 subtypes are expressed in brain, they vary in terms of their peripheral expression, with Cav3.2 showing the widest expression. The electrophysiological activities of recombinant Cav3 channels are very similar to native T-type currents and can be differentiated from HVA channels by their activation at lower voltages, faster inactivation, slower deactivation, and smaller conductance of Ba2+. The Cav3 subtypes can be differentiated by their kinetics and sensitivity to block by Ni2+. The goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive description of T-type currents, their distribution, regulation, pharmacology, and cloning.},

The intrinsic electrophysiological properties of cortical neurons were analyzed from several preparations, and we selected the four most prominent electrophysiological classes of neurons. These four classes are "fast spiking", "regular spiking", "intrinsically bursting" and "low-threshold spike" cells. For each class, we fit "minimal" HH type models to experimental data. The models contain the minimal set of voltage-dependent currents to account for the data. To obtain models as generic as possible, we used data from different preparations in vivo and in vitro, such as rat somatosensory cortex and thalamus, guinea-pig visual and frontal cortex, ferret visual cortex, cat visual cortex and cat association cortex. For two cell classes, we used automatic fitting procedures applied to several cells, which revealed substantial cell-to-cell variability within each class. The selection of such cellular models constitutes a necessary step towards building network simulations of the thalamocortical system with realistic cellular dynamical properties. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Sleep and circadian rhythms are regulated across multiple functional, spatial and temporal levels: from genes to networks of coupled neurons and glial cells, to large scale brain dynamics and behaviour. The dynamics at each of these levels are complex and the interaction between the levels is even more so, so research have mostly focused on interactions within the levels to understand the underlying mechanisms—the so-called reductionist approach. Mathematical models were developed to test theories of sleep regulation and guide new experiments at each of these levels and have become an integral part of the field. The advantage of modelling, however, is that it allows us to simulate and test the dynamics of complex biological systems and thus provides a tool to investigate the connections between the different levels and study the system as a whole. In this paper I review key models of sleep developed at different physiological levels and discuss the potential for an integrated systems biology approach for sleep regulation across these levels. I also highlight the necessity of building mechanistic connections between models of sleep and circadian rhythms across these levels.},

In the model and the biological neuron, the change in burst period caused by inhibitory and excitatory inputs of increasing strength saturated, such that synaptic inputs above a certain strength all had the same effect on the firing pattern of the oscillatory neuron. In contrast, increasing the duration of the synaptic conductance pulses always led to changes in the burst period, indicating that neural oscillators are sensitive to changes in the duration of synaptic input but are not sensitive to changes in the strength of synaptic inputs above a certain conductance. This saturation of the response to progressively stronger synaptic inputs occurs not only in bursting neurons but also in tonically spiking neurons. We identified inward currents at hyperpolarized potentials as the cause of the saturation in the model neuron. Our findings imply that activity-dependent or modulator-induced changes in synaptic strength are not necessarily accompanied by changes in the functional impact of a synapse on the timing of postsynaptic spikes or bursts.},

abstract = {Thalamic relay cells fire in two distinct modes, burst or tonic, and the operative mode is dictated by the inactivation state of low-threshold, voltage-gated, transient (or T-type) Ca2+ channels. Tonic firing is seen when the T channels are inactivated via membrane depolarization, and burst firing is seen when the T channels are activated from a hyperpolarized state. These response modes have very different effects on the relay of information to the cortex. It had been thought that only tonic firing is seen in the awake, alert animal, but recent evidence from several species suggests that bursting may also occur. We have begun to explore this issue in macaque monkeys by recording from thalamic relay cells of unanesthetized, behaving animals. In the lateral geniculate nucleus, the thalamic relay for retinal information, we found that tonic mode dominated responses both during alert behavior as well as during sleep. We nonetheless found burst firing present during the vigilant, waking state. There was, however, considerably more burst mode firing during sleep than wakefulness. Surprisingly, we did not find the bursting during sleep to be rhythmic. We also recorded from relay cells of the somatosensory thalamus. Interestingly, not only did these somatosensory neurons exhibit much more burst mode activity than did geniculate cells, but bursting during sleep was highly rhythmic. It thus appears that the level and nature of relay cell bursting may not be constant across all thalamic nuclei.},

abstract = {Over more than a century of research has established the fact that sleep benefits the retention of memory. In this review we aim to comprehensively cover the field of "sleep and memory" research by providing a historical perspective on concepts and a discussion of more recent key findings. Whereas initial theories posed a passive role for sleep enhancing memories by protecting them from interfering stimuli, current theories highlight an active role for sleep in which memories undergo a process of system consolidation during sleep. Whereas older research concentrated on the role of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, recent work has revealed the importance of slow-wave sleep (SWS) for memory consolidation and also enlightened some of the underlying electrophysiological, neurochemical, and genetic mechanisms, as well as developmental aspects in these processes. Specifically, newer findings characterize sleep as a brain state optimizing memory consolidation, in opposition to the waking brain being optimized for encoding of memories. Consolidation originates from reactivation of recently encoded neuronal memory representations, which occur during SWS and transform respective representations for integration into long-term memory. Ensuing REM sleep may stabilize transformed memories. While elaborated with respect to hippocampus-dependent memories, the concept of an active redistribution of memory representations from networks serving as temporary store into long-term stores might hold also for non-hippocampus-dependent memory, and even for nonneuronal, i.e., immunological memories, giving rise to the idea that the offline consolidation of memory during sleep represents a principle of long-term memory formation established in quite different physiological systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {1. Properties of voltage-dependent Na+ currents were investigated in forty-two dentate granule cells (DGCs) acutely isolated from the resected hippocampus of twenty patients with therapy-refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. 2. Depolarizing voltage commands elicited large, rapidly activating and inactivating Na+ currents (140 pS $\mu$m-2 163 mM extracellular Na+) that were reduced in amplitude by lowering the Na+ gradient (43 mM extracellular Na+). At low temperatures (8-12°C), the time course of Na+ currents slowed and could be well described by the model of Hodgkin and Huxley. 3. Na+ currents were reversibly blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX) and saxitoxin (STX) with a half-maximal block of 4.7 and 2.6 nM, respectively. In order to reduce series resistance errors, the Na+ current was partially blocked by low toxin concentrations (10-15 nM) in the experiments described below. Under these conditions, Na+ currents showed a threshold of activation of about -50 mV, and the voltages of half-maximal activation and inactivation were -29 and -55 mV, respectively. 4. The time course of recovery from inactivation could be described with a double-exponential function (time constants, 3-20 and 60-200 ms). The rapid and slow time constants showed a distinct voltage dependence with maximal values around -55 and -80 mV, respectively. These properties contributed to a reduction of the Na+ currents during repetitive stimulation that was more pronounced with higher stimulation frequencies and also showed a dependence on the holding potential. 5. In summary the most striking features of DGC Na+ currents were the large current density and the presence of a current component showing a slow recovery from inactivation. Our data provide a basis for comparison with properties of Na+ currents in animal models of epilepsy, and for the study of drug actions in therapy-refractory epilepsy.},

abstract = {It is well established that the main intrinsic electrophysiological properties of thalamocortical relay cells, production of a low threshold burst upon release from hyperpolarized potential and production of a train of single spikes following stimulation from depolarized potentials, can be readily modelled using a single compartment. There is, however, another less well explored intrinsic electrophysiological characteristic of relay cells for which models have not yet accounted: at somatic potentials near spike threshold, relay cells produce a fast ragged high threshold oscillation in somatic voltage. Optical [Ca2+] imaging and pharmacological tests indicate that this oscillation correlates with a high threshold Ca2+ current in the dendrites. Here we present the development of a new compartment model of the thalamic relay cell guided by the simultaneous constraints that it must produce the familiar regular spiking relay mode and low threshold rebound bursts which characterize these cells, as well as the less-studied fast oscillation occurring at near-threshold somatic potentials. We arrive at a model cell which is capable of the production of isolated high threshold Ca2+ spikes in distal branch segments, driven by a rapidly inactivating intermediate threshold Ca2+ channel. Further, the model produces the low threshold spike behaviour of the relay cell without requiring high T-current density in the distal dendritic segments. The results thus support a new picture of the dendritic tree of relay cells which may have implications for the manner in which thalamic relay cells integrate descending input from the cortex. {\textcopyright} The Physiological Society 2004.},

This circuit reliably produces a stereotyped fictive pattern of activity and has been extensively characterized. Here we determined, as quantitatively as possible, the strength of each inhibitory synapse and electrical junction within the core circuit of the heartbeat CPG. We also examined the animal-to-animal variability in strengths of these connections and, for some, determined the correlations between connections to the same postsynaptic target. The core CPG is composed of seven bilateral pairs of heart interneurons connected via both inhibitory chemical synapses and electrical junctions. Fifteen different connections within the core CPG were measured for strength using extracellular presynaptic recordings and postsynaptic voltage-clamp recordings across a minimum of seven individuals each, and the animal-to-animal variability was characterized. Connection strengths within the core network varied three to more than sevenfold among individuals (depending on the specific connection). The balance between two inputs onto various postsynaptic targets was explored by within-individual comparisons and correlation across individuals. Of the seven comparisons made within the core CPG, three showed a clear correlation of connection strengths, while the other four did not. We conclude that the leech heartbeat CPG can withstand wide variability in connection strengths and still produce stereotyped output. The network appears to preserve the relative strengths of some pairs of inputs, despite the animal-toanimal variability. {\textcopyright} 2012 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {Background: Although they form a unitary phenomenon, the relationship between extracranial M/EEG and transmembrane ion flows is understood only as a general principle rather than as a well-articulated and quantified causal chain. Method: We present an integrated multiscale model, consisting of a neural simulation of thalamus and cortex during stage N2 sleep and a biophysical model projecting cortical current densities to M/EEG fields. Sleep spindles were generated through the interactions of local and distant network connections and intrinsic currents within thalamocortical circuits. 32,652 cortical neurons were mapped onto the cortical surface reconstructed from subjects' MRI, interconnected based on geodesic distances, and scaled-up to current dipole densities based on laminar recordings in humans. MRIs were used to generate a quasi-static electromagnetic model enabling simulated cortical activity to be projected to the M/EEG sensors. Results: The simulated M/EEG spindles were similar in amplitude and topography to empirical examples in the same subjects. Simulated spindles with more core-dominant activity were more MEG weighted. Comparison with existing methods: Previous models lacked either spindle-generating thalamic neural dynamics or whole head biophysical modeling; the framework presented here is the first to simultaneously capture these disparate scales. Conclusions: This multiscale model provides a platform for the principled quantitative integration of existing information relevant to the generation of sleep spindles, and allows the implications of future findings to be explored. It provides a proof of principle for a methodological framework allowing large-scale integrative brain oscillations to be understood in terms of their underlying channels and synapses.},

abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) has recently been recognized as an important form of intervention for alleviating motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease, but the mechanism underlying its effectiveness remains unknown. Using a computational model, this paper considers the hypothesis that DBS works by replacing pathologically rhythmic basal ganglia output with tonic, high frequency firing. In our simulations of parkinsonian conditions, rhythmic inhibition from GPi to the thalamus compromises the ability of thalamocortical relay (TC) cells to respond to depolarizing inputs, such as sensorimotor signals. High frequency stimulation of STN regularizes GPi firing, and this restores TC responsiveness, despite the increased frequency and amplitude of GPi inhibition to thalamus that result. We provide a mathematical phase plane analysis of the mechanisms that determine TC relay capabilities in normal, parkinsonian, and DBS states in a reduced model. This analysis highlights the differences in deinactivation of the low-threshold calcium T-current that we observe in TC cells in these different conditions. Alternative scenarios involving convergence of thalamic signals in the cortex are also discussed, and predictions associated with these results, including the occurrence of rhythmic rebound bursts in certain TC cells in parkinsonian states and their drastic reduction by DBS, are stated. These results demonstrate how DBS could work by increasing firing rates of target cells, rather than shutting them down. {\textcopyright} 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {We extend a quantitative model for low-voltage, slow-wave excitability based on the T-type calcium current (Wang et al. 1991) by juxtaposing it with a Hodgn-Huxley-like model for fast sodium spiking in the high voltage regime to account for the distinct firing modes of thalamic neurons. We employ bifurcation analysis to illustrate the stimulus-response behavior of the full model under both voltage regimes. The model neuron shows continuous sodium spiking when depolarized sufficiently from rest. Depending on the parameters of calcium current inactivation, there are two types of low-voltage responses to a hyperpolarizing current step: a single rebound low threshold spike (LTS) upon release of the step and periodic LTSs. Bursting is seen as sodium spikes ride the LTS crest. In both cases, we analyze the LTS burst response by projecting its trajectory into a fast/slow phase plane. We also use phase plane methods to show that a potassium A-current shifts the threshold for sodium spikes, reducing the number of fast sodium spikes in an LTS burst. It can also annihilate periodic bursting. We extend the previous work of Rose and Hindmarsh (1989a--c) for a thalamic neuron and propose a simpler model for thalamic activity. We consider burst modulation by using a neuromodulator-dependent potassium leakage conductance as a control parameter. These results correspond with experiments showing that the application of certain neurotransmitters can switch firing modes.},

abstract = {The general objectives of our research, presented in this series of papers, were to develop a computational model of the brain stem respiratory neural network and to explore possible neural mechanisms that provide the genesis of respiratory oscillations and the specific firing patterns of respiratory neurons. The present paper describes models of single respiratory neurons that have been used as the elements in our network models of the central respiratory pattern generator presented in subsequent papers. The models of respiratory neurons were developed in the Hodgkin-Huxley style employing both physiological and biophysical data obtained from brain stem neurons in mammals. Two single respiratory neuron models were developed to match the two distinct firing behaviors of respiratory neurons described in vive: neuron type I shows an adapting firing pattern in response to synaptic excitation, and neuron type II shows a ramp firing pattern during membrane depolarization after a period of synaptic inhibition. We found that a frequency ramp firing pattern can result from intrinsic membrane properties, specifically from the combined influence of calcium-dependent K(AHP)(Ca), low-threshold Ca(T) and K(A) channels. The neuron models with these ionic channels (type II) demonstrated ramp firing patterns similar to those recorded from respiratory neurons in vive. Our simulations show that K(AHP)(Ca) channels in combination with high-threshold Ca(L) channels produce spike frequency adaptation during synaptic excitation. However, in combination with low-threshold Ca(T) channels, they cause a frequency ramp firing response after release from inhibition. This promotes a testable hypothesis that the main difference between the respiratory neurons that adapt (for example, early inspiratory, postinspiratory, and decrementing expiratory) and those that show ramp firing patterns (for example, ramp inspiratory and augmenting expiratory) consists of a ratio between the two types of calcium channels: Ca(L) channels predominate in the former and Ca(T) channels in the latter respiratory neuron types. We have analyzed the dependence of adapting and ramp firing patterns on maximal conductances of different ionic channels and values of synaptic drive. The effect of adjusting specific membrane conductances and synaptic interactions revealed plausible neuronal mechanisms that may underlie modulatory effects on respiratory neuron firing patterns and network performances. The results of computer simulation provide useful insight into functional significance of specific intrinsic membrane properties and their interactions with phasic synaptic inputs for a better understanding of respiratory neuron firing behavior.},

abstract = {Voltage-gated calcium channels contain four highly conserved transmembrane helices known as S4 segments that exhibit a positively charged residue every third position, and play the role of voltage sensing. Nonetheless, the activation range between high-voltage (HVA) and low-voltage (LVA) activated calcium channels is around 30–40 mV apart, despite the high level of amino acid similarity within their S4 segments. To investigate the contribution of S4 voltage sensors for the low-voltage activation characteristics of CaV3.3 channels we constructed chimeras by swapping S4 segments between this LVA channel and the HVA CaV1.2 channel. The substitution of S4 segment of Domain II in CaV3.3 by that of CaV1.2 (chimera IIS4C) induced a {\~{}}35 mV shift in the voltage-dependence of activation towards positive potentials, showing an I-V curve that almost overlaps with that of CaV1.2 channel. This HVA behavior induced by IIS4C chimera was accompanied by a 2-fold decrease in the voltage-dependence of channel gating. The IVS4 segment had also a strong effect in the voltage sensing of activation, while substitution of segments IS4 and IIIS4 moved the activation curve of CaV3.3 to more negative potentials. Swapping of IIS4 voltage sensor influenced additional properties of this channel such as steady-state inactivation, current decay, and deactivation. Notably, Domain I voltage sensor played a major role in preventing CaV3.3 channels to inactivate from closed states at extreme hyperpolarized potentials. Finally, site-directed mutagenesis in the CaV3.3 channel revealed a partial contribution of the S4-S5 linker of Domain II to LVA behavior, with synergic effects observed in double and triple mutations. These findings indicate that IIS4 and, to a lesser degree IVS4, voltage sensors are crucial in determining the LVA properties of CaV3.3 channels, although the accomplishment of this function involves the participation of other structural elements like S4-S5 linkers.},

abstract = {The dorsal column nuclei, cuneatus and gracilis, play a fundamental role in the processing and integration of somesthetic ascending information. Intracellular and patch-clamp recordings obtained in cat in vivo have shown that cuneothalamic projection neurons present two modes of activity: oscillatory and tonic (Canedo et al 1998 Neuroscience 84 603-17). The former is the basis of generating, in sleep and anaesthetized states, slow, delta and spindle rhythms under the control of the cerebral cortex (Mari{\~{n}}o et al 2000 Neuroscience 95 657-73). The latter is needed, during wakefulness, to process somesthetic information in real time. To study this behaviour we have developed the first realistic computational model of the cuneothalamic projection neurons. The modelling was guided by experimental recordings, which suggest the existence of hyperpolarization-activated inward currents, transient low- and high-threshold calcium currents, and calcium-activated potassium currents. The neuronal responses were simulated during (1) sleep, (2) transition from sleep to wakefulness and (3) wakefulness under both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input. In wakefulness the model predicts a set of synaptically driven firing modes that could be associated with information processing strategies in the middle cuneate nucleus.},

In lateral pyloric (LP) neurons, we saw strong correlations between measured current and the abundance of Shal and BK-KCa mRNAs (encoding the Shal-family voltage-gated potassium channel and large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel, respectively). We also saw two- to fourfold interanimal variability for three potassium currents and their mRNA expression. Measurements of channel expression in the two electrically coupled pyloric dilator (PD) neurons showed significant interanimal variability, but copy numbers for IH (encoding the hyperpolarization-activated, inward-current channel) and Shal mRNA in the two PD neurons from the same crab were similar, suggesting that the regulation of some currents may be shared in electrically coupled neurons. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {1. The thalamus has long been seen as responsible for relaying information on the way to the cerebral cortex, but it has not been until the last decade or so that the functional nature of this relay has attracted significant attention. Whereas earlier views tended to relegate thalamic function to a simple, machine-like relay process, recent research, reviewed in this article, demonstrates complicated circuitry and a rich array of membrane properties underlying the thalamic relay. It is now clear that the thalamic relay does not have merely a trivial function. Suggestions that the thalamic circuits and cell properties only come into play during certain phases of sleep to effectively disconnect the relay are correct as far as they go, but they are incomplete, because they fail to take into account interesting and variable properties of the relay that, we argue, occur during normal waking behavior. Although the specific function of the circuits and cellular properties of the thalamic relay for waking behavior is far from clear, we offer two related hypotheses based on recent experimental evidence. One is that the thalamus is not used just to relay peripheral information from, for example, visual, auditory, or cerebellar inputs, but that some thalamic nuclei are arranged instead to relay information from one cortical area to another. The second is that the thalamus is not a simple, passive relay of information to cortex but instead is involved in many dynamic processes that significantly alter the nature of the information relayed to cortex.},

In contrast to asymptomatic, symptomatic subjects (1) displayed less percentage of wakefulness EEG pattern and more non-REM sleep, (2) showed higher beta and less delta EEG power in frontal cortex during non-REM sleep.

Some mid-frequency oscillations showed "complex" frequency structure, consisting of the dominant and subdominant components. "Complex" sleep spindles more frequently appeared in asymptomatic rats than in symptomatic, whereas the dominant frequency of these spindles in symptomatic rats was higher than in asymptomatic (12.7 vs 11.9.

We measured responses during both tonic and burst firing modes to sinusoidal current injection and performed Fourier analysis on these responses. For comparison, we constructed a minimal 'integrate-and-tire-or-burst' (IFB) neuron model that reproduces salient features of the relay cell responses. The IFB model is constrained to quantitatively fit our Fourier analysis of experimental relay neuron responses, including: the temporal tuning of the response in both tonic and burst modes, including a finding of low-pass and sometimes broadband behavior of tonic firing and band-pass characteristics during bursting, and the generally greater linearity of tonic compared with burst responses at low frequencies. In tonic mode, both experimental and theoretical responses display a frequency-dependent transition from massively superharmonic spiking to phase-locked superharmonic spiking near 3 Hz, followed by phase-locked subharmonic spiking at higher frequencies. Subharmonic and superharmonic burst responses also were observed experimentally. Characterizing the response properties of the 'tuned' IFB model leads to insights regarding the observed stimulus dependence of burst versus tonic response mode in relay neurons. Furthermore the simplicity of the IFB model makes it a candidate for large scale network simulations of thalamic functioning.},

abstract = {In a systematic study of thalamocortical relay neuron responses to sinusoidal current injection [J. Neurophysiol. 83 (1), 588], we found that the Fourier fundamental of tonic responses was regularly phase advanced during low temporal frequency stimulation (1/10 cycle at 0.1 Hz). We hypothesized that such phase advances of the Fourier fundamental response were due to a slow spike-frequency adaptation. Here we measure the time-dependence of the instantaneous firing rate during a current pulse protocol, confirm the presence of a slow spike-frequency adaptation, and quantify the adaptation time constant (0.6-2.0 s) and percentage adaptation of spike rate (40-60{\%}). In light of these results, we augment a previously reported minimal integrate-and-fire-or-burst (IFB) neuron model with an adaptation current. When the parameters for this current are fit using a quantitative theory of spike-frequency adaptation [J. Neurophysiol. 79, 1549], the IFB model reproduces the experimentally observed phase advance of the Fourier fundamental response during sinusoidal current injection. Using fast-slow variable analysis, we develop a firing-rate reduction of the IFB model and perform parameter studies to investigate the dependence of the Fourier fundamental response (amplitude and phase) on the maximum conductance and recovery time constant for the adaptation current. Analytical calculations clarify the relationship between dc and ac measures of the suppression of response due to spike-frequency adaptation, show how the latter depends on stimulation frequency, and confirm the adaptation-induced phase advance of the Fourier fundamental observed in both experiment and simulation. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This is because spike cancellation produced by an inhibitory input requires coincidence in time, whereas an excitatory input can add spikes with less temporal constraint. To test for such potential differences, especially in the context of the function of thalamocortical (TC) relay nuclei, we used a stochastic "integrate-and-fire-or-burst" TC neuron model to quantify the detectability of excitatory and inhibitory drive in the presence and absence of the low-threshold Ca2+ current, IT, and the hyperpolarization-activated cation conductance, Isag. We find that excitatory inputs are generally superior drivers compared with inhibitory inputs in part because spontaneous activity of a postsynaptic neuron is not required in the case of excitatory drive. Interestingly, the presence of the low-threshold Ca2+ current, IT in a postsynaptic neuron allows the robust detection of inhibitory drive over a certain range of spontaneous and driven activity, a range that can be extended by the presence of the hyperpolarization-activated cation conductance, Isag. These simulations suggest a possible reinterpretation of the role of inhibitory inputs, such as those to the thalamus.},

abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) and lesioning are two surgical techniques used in the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) in patients whose symptoms are not well controlled by drugs, or who experience dyskinesias as a side effect of medications. Although these treatments have been widely practiced, the mechanisms behind DBS and lesioning are still not well understood. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) are two common targets for both DBS and lesioning. Previous studies have indicated that DBS not only affects local cells within the target, but also passing axons within neighboring regions. Using a computational model of the basal gangliathalamic network, we studied the relative contributions of activation and silencing of local cells (LCs) and fibers of passage (FOPs) to changes in the accuracy of information transmission through the thalamus (thalamic fidelity), which is correlated with the effectiveness of DBS. Activation of both LCs and FOPs during STN and GPi-DBS were beneficial to the outcome of stimulation. During STN and GPi lesioning, effects of silencing LCs and FOPs were different between the two types of lesioning. For STN lesioning, silencing GPi FOPs mainly contributed to its effectiveness, while silencing only STN LCs did not improve thalamic fidelity. In contrast, silencing both GPi LCs and GPe FOPs during GPi lesioning contributed to improvements in thalamic fidelity. Thus, two distinct mechanisms produced comparable improvements in thalamic function: driving the output of the basal ganglia to produce tonic inhibition and silencing the output of the basal ganglia to produce tonic disinhibition. These results show the importance of considering effects of activating or silencing fibers passing close to the nucleus when deciding upon a target location for DBS or lesioning. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

In modeling studies, we find that this form of synaptic modification can automatically balance synaptic strengths to make postsynaptic firing irregular but more sensitive to presynaptic spike timing. It has been argued that neurons in vivo operate in such a balanced regime. Synapses modifiable by STDP compete for control of the timing of postsynaptic action potentials. Inputs that fire the postsynaptic neuron with short latency or that act in correlated groups are able to compete most successfully and develop strong synapses, while synapses of longer-latency or less-effective inputs are weakened.},

abstract = {The intrinsically oscillating neurons in the crustacean pyloric circuit have membrane conductances that influence their spontaneous activity patterns and responses to synaptic activity. The relationship between the magnitudes of these membrane conductances and the response of the oscillating neurons to synaptic input has not yet been fully or systematically explored. We examined this relationship using the phase resetting curve (PRC), which summarizes the change in the cycle period of a neuronal oscillator as a function of the input's timing within the oscillation. We first utilized a large database of single-compartment model neurons to determine the effect of individual membrane conductances on PRC shape; we found that the effects vary across conductance space, but on average, the hyperpolarization-activated and leak conductances advance the PRC. We next investigated how membrane conductances affect PRCs of the isolated pacemaker kernel in the pyloric circuit of Cancer borealis by: (1) tabulating PRCs while using dynamic clamp to artificially add varying levels of specific conductances, and (2) tabulating PRCs before and after blocking the endogenous hyperpolarization-activated current. We additionally used a previously described four-compartment model to determine how the location of the hyperpolarization-activated conductance influences that current's effect on the PRC. We report that while dynamic-clamp-injected leak current has much smaller effects on the PRC than suggested by the single-compartment model, an increase in the hyperpolarization-activated conductance both advances and reduces the noisiness of the PRC in the pacemaker kernel of the pyloric circuit in both modeling and experimental studies.},

We propose a model in which the strengths of inhibitory synapses in a central pattern-generating circuit are subject to activity-dependent plasticity. The strength of each synapse is modified as a function of the global activity of the postsynaptic neuron and by correlated activity of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. This allows the self-assembly, from random initial synaptic strengths, of two cells into reciprocal oscillation and three cells into a rhythmic triphasic motor pattern. This self-assembly illustrates that complex oscillatory circuits that depend on multiple inhibitory synaptic connections can be tuned via simple activity-dependent rules.},

abstract = {In recent experiments, synaptically isolated neurons from rat cortical culture, were stimulated with periodic extra-cellular fixed-amplitude current pulses for extended durations of days. The neuron's response depended on its own history, as well as on the history of the input, and was classified into several modes. Interestingly, in one of the modes the neuron behaved intermittently, exhibiting irregular firing patterns changing in a complex and variable manner over the entire range of experimental timescales, from seconds to days. With the aim of developing a minimal biophysical explanation for these results, we propose a general scheme, that, given a few assumptions (mainly, a timescale separation in kinetics) closely describes the response of deterministic conductance-based neuron models under pulse stimulation, using a discrete time piecewise linear mapping, which is amenable to detailed mathematical analysis. Using this method we reproduce the basic modes exhibited by the neuron experimentally, as well as the mean response in each mode. Specifically, we derive precise closed- form input-output expressions for the transient timescale and firing rates, which are expressed in terms of experimentally measurable variables, and conform with the experimental results. However, the mathematical analysis shows that the resulting firing patterns in these deterministic models are always regular and repeatable (i.e., no chaos), in contrast to the irregular and variable behavior displayed by the neuron in certain regimes. This fact, and the sensitive near-threshold dynamics of the model, indicate that intrinsic ion channel noise has a significant impact on the neuronal response, and may help reproduce the experimentally observed variability, as we also demonstrate numerically. In a companion paper, we extend our analysis to stochastic conductance-based models, and show how these can be used to reproduce the details of the observed irregular and variable neuronal response. {\textcopyright} 2012 Soudry and Meir.},

Intracellular recordings from thalamic and related cortical neurons in vivo demonstrate that, during natural slow-wave sleep oscillations or their experimental models, both thalamic and cortical neurons progressively enhance their responsiveness. This potentiation lasts for several minutes after the end of oscillatory periods. Cortical neurons display self-sustained activity, similar to responses evoked during previous epochs of stimulation, despite the fact that thalamic neurons remain under a powerful hyperpolarizing pressure. These data suggest that, far from being a quiescent state during which the cortex and subcortical structures are globally inhibited, slow-wave sleep may consolidate memory traces acquired during wakefulness in corticothalamic networks. Similar phenomena occur as a consequence of fast oscillations during brain-activated states.},

In this first intracellular study of neocortical activities during waking and sleep states, we hypothesized that synaptic activities during natural states of vigilance have a decisive impact on the observed electrophysiological properties of neurons that were previously studied under anesthesia or in brain slices. We investigated the incidence of different firing patterns in neocortical neurons of awake cats, the relation between membrane potential fluctuations and firing rates, and the input resistance during all states of vigilance. In awake animals, the neurons displaying fast-spiking firing patterns were more numerous, whereas the incidence of neurons with intrinsically bursting patterns was much lower than in our previous experiments conducted on the intact-cortex or isolated cortical slabs of anesthetized cats. Although cortical neurons displayed prolonged hyperpolarizing phases during slow-wave sleep, the firing rates during the depolarizing phases of the slow sleep oscillation was as high during these epochs as during waking and rapid-eye-movement sleep. Maximum firing rates, exceeding those of regular-spiking neurons, were reached by conventional fast-spiking neurons during both waking and sleep states, and by fast-rhythmic-bursting neurons during waking. The input resistance was more stable and it increased during quiet wakefulness, compared with sleep states. As waking is associated with high synaptic activity, we explain this result by a higher release of activating neuromodulators, which produce an increase in the input resistance of cortical neurons. In view of the high firing rates in the functionally disconnected state of slow-wave sleep, we suggest that neocortical neurons are engaged in processing internally generated signals.},

abstract = {Stopping an initiated response could be implemented by a fronto-basal-ganglia circuit, including the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Intracranial recording studies in humans reveal an increase in beta-band power ({\~{}} 16 -20 Hz) within the rIFC and STN when a response is stopped. This suggests that the beta-band could be important for communication in this network. If this is the case, then altering one region should affect the electrophysiological response at the other. We addressed this hypothesis by recording scalp EEG during a stop task while modulating STN activity with deep brain stimulation. We studied 15 human patients with Parkinson's disease and 15 matched healthy control subjects. Behaviorally, patients OFF stimulation were slower than controls to stop their response. Moreover, stopping speed was improved for ON compared to OFF stimulation. For scalp EEG, there was greater beta power, around the time of stopping, for patients ON compared to OFF stimulation. This effect was stronger over the right compared to left frontal cortex, consistent with the putative right lateralization of the stopping network. Thus, deep brain stimulation of the STN improved behavioral stopping performance and increased the beta-band response over the right frontal cortex. These results complement other evidence for a structurally connected functional circuit between right frontal cortex and the basal ganglia. The results also suggest that deep brain stimulation of the STN may improve task performance by increasing the fidelity of information transfer within a fronto-basal-ganglia circuit. {\textcopyright} 2011 the authors.},

Using in situ hybridization, we have localized central and peripheral nervous system expression of three transcripts ($\alpha$1G, $\alpha$1H, and $\alpha$1I) of the T-type calcium channel family (Ca(v)T). Each mRNA demonstrated a unique distribution, and expression of the three genes was largely complementary. We found high levels of expression of these transcripts in regions associated with prominent T-type currents, including inferior olivary and thalamic relay neurons (which expressed $\alpha$1G), sensory ganglia, pituitary, and dentate gyrus granule neurons ($\alpha$1H), and thalamic reticular neurons ($\alpha$1I and $\alpha$1H). Other regions of high expression included the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the claustrum ($\alpha$1G), the olfactory tubercles ($\alpha$1H and $\alpha$1I), and the subthalamic nucleus ($\alpha$1I and $\alpha$1G). Some neurons expressed high levels of all three genes, including hippocampal pyramidal neurons and olfactory granule cells. Many brain regions showed a predominance of labeling for $\alpha$1G, including the amygdala, cerebral cortex, rostral hypothalamus, brainstem, and spinal cord. Exceptions included the basal ganglia, which showed more prominent labeling for $\alpha$1H and $\alpha$1I, and the olfactory bulb, the hippocampus, and the caudal hypothalamus, which showed more even levels of all three transcripts. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that differential gene expression underlies pharmacological and physiological heterogeneity observed in neuronal T-type calcium currents, and they provide a molecular basis for the study of T-type channels in particular neurons.},

Because these currents are nonlinear, it can be difficult to determine the role each current plays in determining how a neuron fires. The lateral pyloric (LP) neuron of the stomatogastric ganglion of decapod crustaceans has been studied extensively biophysically. We constructed ∼600,000 versions of a four-compartment model of the LP neuron and distributed 11 different currents into the compartments. From these, we selected ∼1300 models that match well the electrophysiological properties of the biological neuron. Interestingly, correlations that were seen in the expression of channel mRNA in biological studies were not found across the ∼1300 admissible LP neuron models, suggesting that the electrical phenotype does not require these correlations. We used cubic fits of the function from maximal conductances to a series of electrophysiological properties to ask which conductances predominantly influence input conductance, resting membrane potential, resting spike rate, phasing of activity in response to rhythmic inhibition, and several other properties. In all cases, multiple conductances contribute to the measured property, and the combinations of currents that strongly influence each property differ. These methods can be used to understand how multiple currents in any candidate neuron interact to determine the cell's electrophysiological behavior.

abstract = {Neuronal identity depends on the regulated expression of numerous molecular components, especially ionic channels, which determine the electrical signature of a neuron. Such regulation depends on at least two key factors, activity itself and neuromodulatory input. Neuronal electrical activity can modify the expression of ionic currents in homeostatic or nonhomeostatic fashion. Neuromodulators typically modify activity by regulating the properties or expression levels of subsets of ionic channels. In the stomatogastric system of crustaceans, both types of regulation have been demonstrated. Furthermore, the regulation of the coordinated expression of ionic currents and the channels that carry these currents has been recently reported in diverse neuronal systems, with neuromodulators not only controlling the absolute levels of ionic current expression but also, over long periods of time, appearing to modify their correlated expression. We hypothesize that neuromodulators may regulate the correlated expression of ion channels at multiple levels and in a cell-type-dependent fashion. We report that in two identified neuronal types, three ionic currents are linearly correlated in a pairwise manner, suggesting their coexpression or direct interactions, under normal neuromodulatory conditions. In each cell, some currents remain correlated after neuromodulatory input is removed, whereas the correlations between the other pairs are either lost or altered. Interestingly, in each cell, a different suite of currents change their correlation. At the transcript level we observe distinct alterations in correlations between channel mRNA amounts, including one of the cell types lacking a correlation under normal neuromodulatory conditions and then gaining the correlation when neuromodulators are removed. Synaptic activity does not appear to contribute, with one possible exception, to the correlated expression of either ionic currents or of the transcripts that code for the respective channels. We conclude that neuromodulators regulate the correlated expression of ion channels at both the transcript and the protein levels. {\textcopyright} 2012 the American Physiological Society.},

Computer simulations and analysis of this model illuminate the roles of the coupling architecture of the network, and associated synaptic conductances, in modulating the activity patterns displayed by this network. Depending on the relationships of these coupling parameters, the network can support three general classes of sustained firing patterns: clustering, propagating waves, and repetitive spiking that may show little regularity or correlation. Each activity pattern can occur continuously or in discrete episodes. We characterize the mechanisms underlying these rhythms, as well as the influence of parameters on details such as spiking frequency and wave speed. These results suggest that the subthalamopallidal circuit is capable both of correlated rhythmic activity and of irregular autonomous patterns of activity that block rhythmicity. Increased striatal input to, and weakened intrapallidal inhibition within, the indirect pathway can switch the behavior of the circuit from irregular to rhythmic. This may be sufficient to explain the emergence of correlated oscillatory activity in the subthalamopallidal circuit after destruction of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson{\&}{\#}039;s disease and in animal models of parkinsonism.},

abstract = {Our current understanding of the basal ganglia has facilitated the creation of computational models that have contributed novel theories, explored new functional anatomy and demonstrated results complementing physiological experiments. However, the utility of these models extends beyond these applications. Particularly in neuromorphic engineering, where the basal ganglia's role in computation is important for applications such as power efficient autonomous agents and model-based control strategies. The neurons used in existing computational models of the basal ganglia however, are not amenable for many low-power hardware implementations. Motivated by a need for more hardware accessible networks, we replicate four published models of the basal ganglia, spanning single neuron and small networks, replacing the more computationally expensive neuron models with an Izhikevich hybrid neuron. This begins with a network modeling action-selection, where the basal activity levels and the ability to appropriately select the most salient input is reproduced. A Parkinson's disease model is then explored under normal conditions, Parkinsonian conditions and during subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation. The resulting network is capable of replicating the loss of thalamic relay capabilities in the Parkinsonian state and its return under deep brain stimulation. This is also demonstrated using a network capable of action-selection. Finally, a study of correlation transfer under different patterns of Parkinsonian activity is presented. These networks successfully captured the significant results of the originals studies. This not only creates a foundation for neuromorphic hardware implementations but may also support the development of large-scale biophysical models. The former potentially providing a way of improving the efficacy of deep brain stimulation and the latter allowing for the efficient simulation of larger more comprehensive networks. {\textcopyright} 2013 Thibeault and Srinivasa.},

abstract = {Sleep is universal, tightly regulated, and its loss impairs cognition. But why does the brain need todisconnect from the environment for hours every day? The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY)proposes that sleep is the price the brain pays for plasticity. During a waking episode, learning statistical regularities about the current environment requires strengthening connections throughout thebrain. This increases cellular needs for energy and supplies, decreases signal-to-noise ratios, and saturates learning. During sleep, spontaneous activity renormalizes net synaptic strength and restores cellular homeostasis. Activity-dependent down-selection of synapses can also explain the benefits of sleep on memory acquisition, consolidation, and integration. This happens through the offline, comprehensive sampling of statistical regularities incorporated in neuronal circuits over a lifetime. This Perspective considers the rationale and evidence for SHY and points to open issues related to sleep and plasticity. What is the purpose of sleep? The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY) proposes that sleep renormalizes net synaptic strength and restores cellular homeostasis. Tononi and Cirelli review the rationale and evidence behind SHY and discuss open issues related to sleep and plasticity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This paper reviews a novel hypothesis about the functions of slow wave sleep - the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis. According to the hypothesis, plastic processes occurring during wakefulness result in a net increase in synaptic strength in many brain circuits. The role of sleep is to downscale synaptic strength to a baseline level that is energetically sustainable, makes efficient use of gray matter space, and is beneficial for learning and memory. Thus, sleep is the price we have to pay for plasticity, and its goal is the homeostatic regulation of the total synaptic weight impinging on neurons. The hypothesis accounts for a large number of experimental facts, makes several specific predictions, and has implications for both sleep and mood disorders. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {To better understand population phenomena in thalamocortical neuronal ensembles, we have constructed a preliminary network model with 3,560 multicompartment neurons (containing soma, branching dendrites, and a portion of axon). Types of neurons included superficial pyramids (with regular spiking [RS] and fast rhythmic bursting [FRB] firing behaviors); RS spiny stellates; fast spiking (FS) interneurons, with basket-type and axoaxonic types of connectivity, and located in superficial and deep cortical layers; low threshold spiking (LTS) interneurons, which contacted principal cell dendrites; deep pyramids, which could have RS or intrinsic bursting (IB) firing behaviors, and endowed either with nontufted apical dendrites or with long tufted apical dendrites: thalamocortical relay (TCR) cells; and nucleus reticularis (nRT) cells. To the extent possible, both electrophysiology and synaptic connectivity were based on published data, although many arbitrary choices were necessary. In addition to synaptic connectivity (by AMPA/kainate, NMDA, and GABAA receptors), we also included electrical coupling between dendrites of interneurons, nRT cells, and TCR cells, and-in various combinations-electrical coupling between the proximal axons of certain cortical principal neurons. Our network model replicates several observed population phenomena, including 1) persistent gamma oscillations; 2) thalamocortical sleep spindles; 3) series of synchronized population bursts, resembling electrographic seizures; 4) isolated double population bursts with superimposed very fast oscillations ({\textgreater}100 Hz, "VFO"); 5) spike-wave, polyspike-wave, and fast runs (about 10 Hz). We show that epileptiform bursts, including double and multiple bursts, containing VFO occur in rat auditory cortex in vitro, in the presence of kainate, when both GABAA and GABAB receptors are blocked. Electrical coupling between axons appears necessary (as reported previously) for persistent gamma and additionally plays a role in the detailed shaping of epileptogenic events. The degree of recurrent synaptic excitation between spiny stellate cells, and their tendency to fire throughout multiple bursts, also appears critical in shaping epileptogenic events.

abstract = {Serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus, with their extensive innervation of limbic and higher brain regions and interactions with the endocrine system have important modulatory or regulatory effects on many cognitive, emotional and physiological processes. They have been strongly implicated in responses to stress and in the occurrence of major depressive disorder and other psychiatric disorders. In order to quantify some of these effects, detailed mathematical models of the activity of such cells are required which describe their complex neurochemistry and neurophysiology. We consider here a single-compartment model of these neurons which is capable of describing many of the known features of spike generation, particularly the slow rhythmic pacemaking activity often observed in these cells in a variety of species. Included in the model are 11 kinds of ion channels: a fast sodium current INa, a delayed rectifier potassium current IKDR, a transient potassium current IA, a slow non-inactivating potassium current IM, a low-threshold calcium current IT, two high threshold calcium currents IL and IN, small and large conductance potassium currents ISK and IBK, a hyperpolarization-activated cation current IH and a leak current ILeak. In Sections 3-8, each current type is considered in detail and parameters estimated from voltage clamp data where possible. Three kinds of model are considered for the BK current and two for the leak current. Intracellular calcium ion concentration Cai is an additional component and calcium dynamics along with buffering and pumping is discussed in Section 9. The remainder of the article contains descriptions of computed solutions which reveal both spontaneous and driven spiking with several parameter sets. Attention is focused on the properties usually associated with these neurons, particularly long duration of action potential, steep upslope on the leading edge of spikes, pacemaker-like spiking, long-lasting afterhyperpolarization and the ramp-like return to threshold after a spike. In some cases the membrane potential trajectories display doublets or have humps or notches as have been reported in some experimental studies. The computed time courses of IA and IT during the interspike interval support the generally held view of a competition between them in influencing the frequency of spiking. Spontaneous activity was facilitated by the presence of IH which has been found in these neurons by some investigators. For reasonable sets of parameters spike frequencies between about 0.6Hz and 1.2Hz are obtained, but frequencies as high as 6Hz could be obtained with special parameter choices. Topics investigated and compared with experiment include shoulders, notches, anodal break phenomena, the effects of noradrenergic input, frequency versus current curves, depolarization block, effects of cell size and the effects of IM. The inhibitory effects of activating 5-HT1A autoreceptors are also investigated. There is a considerable discussion of in vitro versus in vivo firing behavior, with focus on the roles of noradrenergic input, corticotropin-releasing factor and orexinergic inputs. Location of cells within the nucleus is probably a major factor, along with the state of the animal. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Long-term isolation in culture changed their intrinsic activity from tonic firing to burst firing.

abstract = {The subthalamic nucleus (STN) powerfully controls basal ganglia outputs and has been implicated in movement disorders observed in Parkinson's disease because of its pathological mixed burst firing mode and hyperactivity. A recent study suggested that reciprocally connected glutamatergic STN and GABAergic globus pallidus (GP) neurons act in vitro as a generator of bursting activity in basal ganglia. In vivo, we reported that GP neurons increased their firing rate in wakefulness (W) compared with slow-wave sleep (SWS) without any change in their random pattern. In contrast, STN neurons exhibited similar firing rates in W and SWS, with an irregular pattern in W and a bursty one in SWS. Thus, the pallidal GABAergic tone might control the STN pattern. This hypothesis was tested by mimicking such variations with microiontophoresis of GABA receptor ligands. GABA agonists specifically decreased the STN firing rate but did not affect its firing pattern. GABAA (but not GABAB) antagonists strongly enhanced the STN mean discharge rate during all vigilance states up to three to five times its basal activity. However, such applications did not change the typical W random pattern. When applied during SWS, GABAA antagonists strongly reinforced the spontaneous bursty pattern into a particularly marked one with instantaneous frequencies reaching 500-600 Hz. SWS-W transitions occurring during ongoing antagonist iontophoresis invariably disrupted the bursty pattern into a random one. Thus GABAA receptors play a critical, but not exclusive, role in regulating the excitatory STN influence on basal ganglia outputs.},

This article studies the modulation properties of the multiquadratic integrate-and-fire model, a generalization of the classical quadratic integrate-and-fire model. The model is shown to combine the computational economy of integrate-and-fire modeling and the physiological interpretability of conductance-based modeling.

abstract = {In spite of the uniform appearance of sleep as a behavior, the sleeping brain does not produce electrical activities in unison. Different types of brain rhythms arise during sleep and vary between layers, areas, or from one functional system to another. Local heterogeneity of such activities, here referred to as local sleep, overturns fundamental tenets of sleep as a globally regulated state. However, little is still known about the neuronal circuits involved and how they can generate their own specifically-tuned sleep patterns. NREM sleep patterns emerge in the brain from interplay of activity between thalamic and cortical networks. Within this fundamental circuitry, it now turns out that the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) acts as a key player in local sleep control. This is based on a marked heterogeneity of the TRN in terms of its cellular and synaptic architecture, which leads to a regional diversity of NREM sleep hallmarks, such as sleep spindles, delta waves and slow oscillations. This provides first evidence for a subcortical circuit as a determinant of cortical local sleep features. Here, we review novel cellular and functional insights supporting TRN heterogeneity and how these elements come together to account for local NREM sleep. We also discuss open questions arising from these studies, focusing on mechanisms of sleep regulation and the role of local sleep in brain plasticity and cognitive functions.},

The network adaptation capabilities are tested on navigation benchmarks in a meta-reinforcement learning context and compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

One of the strongest arguments against a role for sleep in declarative memory involves the demonstration that the marked suppression or elimination of REM sleep in subjects on antidepressant drugs or with brainstem lesions produces no detrimental effects on cognition. Procedural memory, like declarative memory, undergoes a slow, time-dependent period of consolidation. A process has recently been described wherein performance on some procedural tasks improves with the mere passage of time and has been termed "enhancement." Some studies, but not others, have reported that the consolidation/enhancement of perceptual and motor skills is dependent on sleep. We suggest that consolidation or enhancement, initiated in waking with task acquisition, could in some instances extend to sleep, but sleep would serve no unique role in these processes.

The full model includes a model for a specialized class of high-threshold thalamocortical cells (HTC cells), which burst at the alpha frequency at depolarized membrane potentials (∼-56 mV). Our model generates alpha activity when the actions of either muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) or metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) agonists on thalamic reticular (RE), thalamocortical (TC), and HTC cells are mimicked. In our model of mGluR1-induced alpha, TC cells are equally likely to fire during any phase of alpha, consistent with in vitro experiments. By contrast, in our model of mAChR-induced alpha, TC cells tend to fire either at the peak or the trough of alpha, depending on conditions. Our modeling suggests that low levels of mGluR1 activation on a background of mAChR agonists may be able to initiate alpha activity that biases TC cells to fire at certain phases of alpha, offering a pathway for cortical control. If we introduce a strong stimulus by increasing the frequency of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) to TC cells, an increase in alpha power is needed to mimic the level of phasing of TC cells observed in vivo. This increased alpha power reduces the probability that TC cells spike near the trough of alpha. We suggest that mAChR-induced alpha may contribute to grouping TC activity into discrete perceptual units for processing, whereas mGluR1-induced alpha may serve the purpose of blocking unwanted stimuli fromreaching the cortex.},

With moderate change of membrane parameter values, the model neuron can exhibit both the spindle and delta rhythms, at different levels of hyperpolarization; only the slower (delta) one or none. In the case when the model neuron is not intrinsically oscillatory, its response to rhythmic hyperpolarization is complex, and displays the "intermittent phase-locking" phenomenon where bursts of Na+ action potentials occur infrequently but their occurrence is phase-locked to the rhythmic input. The rhythmic bursting, whenever possible, is shown to emerge (bifurcate) from a subthreshold oscillation. Near the bifurcation chaotic discharge patterns are observed, where spikes occur intermittently at randomly chosen cycles of a mostly subthreshold slow oscillation. Furthermore, when both the spindle and delta modes can be realized, the transition between the two appears as a sudden drop of the rhythmic frequency with increased hyperpolarization. The T-type calcium current and the sag current may explain the "intermittent phase-locking" phenomenon that is characteristic to thalamic relay neurons during spindle oscillation and provide a cellular basis for the 7-14 Hz rhythm and the slower 0.5-4 Hz rhythm. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

The T-type Ca2+ current is described according to the Hodgkin-Huxley scheme, using the m3h format, with rate constants determined from the experimental data (22-24°C; extracellular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+](o) = 3 mM). The T-type Ca2+ current inactivates rapidly during maintained depolarization (time constant, $\tau$(h) ≃ 20 ms at -20 mV), yet recovery from inactivation is slow (time constant, $\tau$(r) ≃ 270 ms at -80 mV).

Outward currents are not required to reproduce the basic shape of the LTS. The LTS can be activated with either a depolarizing current step from a sufficiently hyperpolarized level or on termination of a hyperpolarizing current step. In either case, the amplitude of the LTS is a monotonically increasing, sigmoid-shaped function of the hyperpolarizing current step intensity. Because of the slower kinetic step of the channel's inactivation gate, our model predicts that recovery of the LTS to greater than one-half amplitude would require a prolonged hyperpolarization of {\textgreater}100 ms (at body temperature). This imposes an upper limit (≃10 Hz) on the frequency of repetitive hyperpolarizations that can elicit a train of LTSs and hence on the frequency of any rhythm that requires LTS-mediated bursting of thalamic neurons. This finding is consistent with the views that the T-type Ca2+ current in thalamic neurons is critical to the generation of the 10-Hz spindle oscillations and that it may also play a role in the epileptic discharge during absence seizures.},

abstract = {Relay neurons in dorsal thalamic nuclei can fire high-frequency bursts of action potentials that ride the crest of voltage-dependent transient (T-type) calcium currents [low-threshold spike (LTS)]. To explore potential nucleus-specific burst features, we compared the membrane properties of dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and pulvinar nucleus relay neurons using in vitro whole-cell recording in juvenile and adult tree shrew (Tupaia) tissue slices. We injected current ramps of variable slope into neurons that were sufficiently hyperpolarized to de-inactivate T-type calcium channels. In a small percentage of juvenile pulvinar and dLGN neurons, an LTS could not be evoked. In the remaining juvenile neurons and in all adult dLGN neurons, a single LTS could be evoked by current ramps. However, in the adult pulvinar, current ramps evoked multiple LTSs in {\textgreater}70{\%} of recorded neurons. Using immunohistochemistry, Western blot techniques, unbiased stereology, and confocal and electron microscopy, we found that pulvinar neurons expressed more T-type calcium channels (Ca v 3.2) and more small conductance potassium channels (SK2) than dLGN neurons and that the pulvinar nucleus contained a higher glia-to-neuron ratio than the dLGN. Hodgkin-Huxley-type compartmental models revealed that the distinct firing modes could be replicated by manipulating T-type calcium and SK2 channel density, distribution, and kinetics. The intrinsic properties of pulvinar neurons that promote burst firing in the adult may be relevant to the treatment of conditions that involve the adult onset of aberrant thalamocortical interactions. {\textcopyright} 2011 the authors.},

abstract = {Thalamic neurons can exhibit two distinct firing modes: tonic and burst. In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the tonic mode appears as a relatively faithful relay of visual information from retina to cortex. The function of the burst mode is less understood. Its prevalence during slow-wave sleep (SWS) and linkage to synchronous cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) suggest that it has an important role during this form of sleep. Although not nearly as common, bursting can also occur during wakefulness. The goal of this study was to identify conditions that affect burst probability, and to compare burst incidence during sleeping and waking. LGN neurons are extraordinarily heterogenous in the degree to which they burst, during both sleeping and waking. Some LGN neurons never burst under any conditions during wakefulness, and several never burst during slow-wave sleep. During wakefulness, {\textless}1{\%} of action potentials were associated with bursting, whereas during sleep this fraction jumps to 18{\%}. Although bursting was most common during slow-wave sleep, more than 50{\%} of the bursting originated from 14{\%} of the LGN cells. Bursting during sleep was largely restricted to episodes lasting 1-5 s, with ∼47{\%} of these episodes being rhythmic and in the delta frequency range (0.5-4 Hz). In wakefulness, although visual stimulation accounted for the greatest number of bursts, it was still a small fraction of the total response (4{\%}, 742 bursts/17,744 cycles in 93 cells). We identified two variables that appeared to influence burst probability: size of the visual stimuli used to elicit responses and behavioral state. Increased stimulus size increased burst probability. We attribute this to the increased influence large stimuli have on a cell's inhibitory mechanisms. As with sleep, a large fraction of bursting originated from a small number of cells. During visual stimulation, 50{\%} of bursting was generated by 9{\%} of neurons. Increased vigilance was negatively correlated with burst probability. Visual stimuli presented during active fixation (i.e., when the animal must fixate on an overt fixation point) were less likely to produce bursting, than when the same visual stimuli were presented but no fixation point present ("passive" fixation). Such observations suggest that even brief departures from attentive states can hyperpolarize neurons sufficiently to de-inactivate the burst mechanism. Our results provide a new view of the temporal structure of bursting during slow-wave sleep: one that supports episodic rhythmic activity in the intact animal. In addition, because bursting could be tied to specific conditions within wakefulness, we suggest that bursting has a specific function within that state.},

abstract = {The influence of cortical feedback on thalamic visual responses has been a source of much discussion in recent years. In this study we examine the possible role of cortical feedback in shaping the spatiotemporal receptive field (STRF) responses of thalamocortical (TC) cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus. A population-based computational model of the thalamocortical network is used to generate a representation of the STRF response of LGN TC cells within the corticothalamic feedback circuit. The cortical feedback is shown to have little influence on the spatial response properties of the STRF organization. However, the model suggests that cortical feedback may play a key role in modifying the experimentally observed biphasic temporal response property of the STRF, that is, the reversal over time of the polarity of ON and OFF responses of the centre and surround of the receptive field, in particular accounting for the experimentally observed mismatch between retinal cells and TC cells in respect of the magnitude of the second (rebound) phase of the temporal response. The model results also show that this mismatch may result from an anti-phase corticothalamic feedback mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

In vertebrates, electrical signals and the resulting intracel- lular calcium transients control contraction of muscle, secretion of hormones, sensation of the environment, processing of information in the brain, and output from the brain to peripheral tissues. In nonexcitable cells, calcium transients signal many key cellular events, in- cluding secretion, gene expression, and cell division. In epithelial cells, huge ion fluxes are conducted across tissue boundaries. All of these physiological processes are mediated in part by members of the voltage-gated ion channel protein superfamily (Fig. 1) (Yu and Catter- all, 2004). This protein superfamily of more than 140 members is one of the largest groups of signal transduc- tion proteins, and many family members are the molec- ular targets for toxins and therapeutic agents.

LVAs differ in their localization and molecular, biophysical, and biochemical properties, but all conduct a transient calcium current in a variety of cells. T-type currents mediate a number of physiological functions in developing and mature cells, and are implicated in neural and cardiovascular diseases. Hampered by a lack of selective antagonists, characterization of T-type channels has come from recombinant channel studies and use of pharmacological and electrophysiological methods to isolate endogenous T-type currents. The surprising heterogeneity in T-type currents likely results from differences in LVA molecular composition, temporal and spatial localization, and association with modulatory molecules. A fundamental knowledge of LVA biochemical properties, including the molecular composition of endogenous LVAs and spatial and temporal characterization of protein expression, is necessary to elucidate mechanisms for regulation of expression and function in normal and diseased cells.},

abstract = {All thalamic relay cells display a voltage-dependent low-threshold Ca2+ spike that plays an important role in relay of information to cortex. We investigated activation properties of this spike in relay cells of the cat's lateral geniculate nucleus using the combined approach of current- clamp intracellular recording from thalamic slices and simulations with a reduced model based on voltage-clamp data. Our experimental data from 42 relay cells showed that the actual Ca2+ spike activates in a nearly all- or-none manner and in this regard is similar to the conventional Na+/K+ action potential except that its voltage dependency is more hyperpolarized and its kinetics are slower. When the cell's membrane potential was hyperpolarized sufficiently to deinactivate much of the low-threshold Ca2+ current (I(T)) underlying the Ca2+ spike, depolarizing current injections typically produced a purely ohmic response when subthreshold and a full- blown Ca2+ spike of nearly invariant amplitude when suprathreshold. The transition between the ohmic response and activated Ca2+ spikes was abrupt and reflected a difference in depolarizing inputs of {\textless}1 mV. However, activation of a full-blown Ca2+ spike was preceded by a slower period of depolarization that was graded with the amplitude of current injection, and the full-blown Ca2+ spike activated when this slower depolarization reached a sufficient membrane potential, a quasithreshold. As a result, the latency of the evoked Ca2+ spike became less with stronger activating inputs because a stronger input produced a stronger depolarization that reached the critical membrane potential earlier. Although Ca2+ spikes were activated in a nearly all-or-none manner from a given holding potential, their actual amplitudes were related to these holding potentials, which, in turn, determined the level of I(T) deinactivation. Our simulations could reproduce all of the main experimental observations. They further suggest that the voltage-dependent K+ conductance underlying I(A), which is known to delay firing in many cells, does not seem to contribute to the variable latency seen in activation of Ca2+ spikes. Instead the simulations indicate that the activation of I(T) starts initially with a slow and graded depolarization until enough of the underling transient (or T) Ca2+ channels are recruited to produce a fast, 'autocatalytic' depolarization seen as the Ca2+ spike. This can produce variable latency dependent on the strength of the initial activation of T channels. The nearly all-or-none nature of Ca2+ spike activation suggests that when a burst of action potentials normally is evoked as a result of a Ca2+ spike and transmitted to cortex, this signal is largely invariant with the amplitude of the input activating the relay cell.},

During burst mode, both low-threshold (LT) and high-threshold (HT) calcium channels are activated, while in tonic mode, only the HT-type of calcium channel is activated. The calcium signals associated with each firing mode were investigated in rat thalamic slices using whole cell patch clamping and confocal calcium imaging. Action potentials were induced by direct current injection into thalamic relay cells loaded with a fluorescent calcium indicator. In both tonic and burst firing modes, large calcium signals were recorded throughout the soma and proximal dendrites. To map the distribution of the channels mediating these calcium fluxes, LT and HT currents were independently activated using specific voltage-clamp protocols. We focused on the proximal region of the cell (up to 50 $\mu$m from the soma) because it appeared to be well clamped. For a voltage pulse of a given size, the largest calcium signals were observed in the proximal dendrites with smaller signals occurring in the soma and nucleus. This was true for both LT and HT signals. Rapid imaging, using one-dimensional linescans, was used to more precisely localize the calcium influx. For both LT and HT channels, calcium influx occurred simultaneously throughout all imaged regions including the soma and proximal dendrites. The presence of sizable calcium signals in the dendrites, soma, and nucleus during both firing modes, and the presence of LT calcium channels in the proximal dendrite where sensory afferents synapse, have implications for both the electrical functioning of relay cells and the transmission of sensory information to cortex.},

abstract = {We used whole-cell patch recording to study 102 local interneurons in the rat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in vitro. Input impedance with this technique (607.0 ± 222.4 M$\Omega$) was far larger than that measured with sharp electrode techniques, suggesting that interneurons may be more electrotonically compact than previously believed. Consistent and robust burst firing was observed in all interneurons when a slight depolarizing boost was given from a potential at, or slightly hyperpolarized from, resting membrane potential. These bursts had some similarities to the low-threshold spike described previously in other thalamic neuron types. The bursting responses were blocked by Ni+, suggesting that the low-threshold calcium current I(T), responsible for the low-threshold spike, was also involved in interneuron burst firing. Compared to the low-threshold spike of thalamocortical cells, however, the interneuron bursts were of relatively long duration and low intraburst frequency. The requirement for a depolarizing boost to elicit the burst is consistent with previous reports of a depolarizing shift of the I(T) activation curve of interneurons relative to thalamocortical cells, a finding we confirmed using voltage-clamp. Voltage- clamp study also revealed an additional long-lasting current that could be tentatively identified as the calcium activated non-selective cation current, I(CAN), based on reversal potential and on pharmacological characteristics. Computer simulation of the interneuron burst demonstrated that its particular morphology is likely due to the interaction of I(T) and I(CAN). In the slice, bursts could also be elicited by stimulation of the optic tract, suggesting that they may occur in response to natural stimulation. Synaptically triggered bursts were only partially blocked by Ni+, but could then be completely blocked by further addition of (±)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid. The existence of robust bursts in this cell type suggests an additional role for interneurons in sculpting sensory responses by feedforward inhibition of thalamocortical cells. The low-threshold spike is a mechanism whereby activity in a neuron is dependent on a prior lack of activity in that same neuron. Understanding of the low-threshold spike in the other major neuron types of the thalamus has brought many new insights into how thalamic oscillations might be involved in sleep and epilepsy. Our description of this phenomenon in the interneurons of the thalamus suggests that these network oscillations might be even more complicated than previously believed.},

Here, we review recent evidence supporting that the Cav3 subunits of T-channels are modulated by endogenous ligands such as anandamide, zinc, redox and oxidizing agents, as well as G-protein and protein kinases pathways. The study of T-channel mutations associated with childhood absence epilepsy has also revealed new aspects of Cav3 subunit trafficking. Collectively, these findings identify novel regulatory mechanisms involved in the fine tuning of T-channel expression and activity, and offer new directions for the design of novel therapeutic strategies targeting these channels. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Voltage-gated calcium channels are required for many key functions in the body. In this review, the different subtypes of voltage-gated calcium channels are described and their physiologic roles and pharmacology are outlined. We describe the current uses of drugs interacting with the different calcium channel subtypes and subunits, as well as specific areas in which there is strong potential for future drug development. Current therapeutic agents include drugs targeting L-type CaV1.2 calcium channels, particularly 1,4-dihydropyridines, which are widely used in the treatment of hypertension. T-type (CaV3) channels are a target of ethosuximide, widely used in absence epilepsy. The auxiliary subunit a2d-1 is the therapeutic target of the gabapentinoid drugs, which are of value in certain epilepsies and chronic neuropathic pain. The limited use of intrathecal ziconotide, a peptide blocker of N-type (CaV2.2) calcium channels, as a treatment of intractable pain, gives an indication that these channels represent excellent drug targets for various pain conditions. We describe how selectivity for different subtypes of calcium channels (e.g., CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 L-type channels) may be achieved in the future by exploiting differences between channel isoforms in terms of sequence and biophysical properties, variation in splicing in different target tissues, and differences in the properties of the target tissues themselves in terms of membrane potential or firing frequency. Thus, use-dependent blockers of the different isoforms could selectively block calcium channels in particular pathologies, such as nociceptive neurons in pain states or in epileptic brain circuits. Of important future potential are selective CaV1.3 blockers for neuropsychiatric diseases, neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease, and resistant hypertension. In addition, selective or nonselective T-type channel blockers are considered potential therapeutic targets in epilepsy, pain, obesity, sleep, and anxiety. Use-dependent N-type calcium channel blockers are likely to be of therapeutic use in chronic pain conditions. Thus, more selective calcium channel blockers hold promise for therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {zinc(Zn2+) functions as a signalling molecule in the nervous system and modulates many ionic channels. In this study, we have explored the effects of Zn2+ on recombinant T-type calcium channels (CaV3.1, CaV3.2 and CaV3.3). Using tsA-201 cells, we demonstrate that CaV3.2 current (IC50,0.8 $\mu$M) is significantly more sensitive to Zn2+ than are CaV3.1 and CaV3.3 currents (IC50, 80 $\mu$M and ∼ 160 $\mu$M, respectively). This inhibition of CaV3 currents is associated with a shift to more negative membrane potentials of both steady-state inactivation for CaV3.1, CaV3.2 and CaV3.3 and steady-state activation for CaV3.1 and CaV3.3 currents. We also document changes in kinetics, especially a significant slowing of the inactivation kinetics for CaV3.1 and CaV3.3, but not for CaV3.2 currents. Notably, deactivation kinetics are significantly slowed for CaV3.3 current (∼100-fold), but not for CaV3.1 and CaV 3.2 currents. Consequently, application of Zn2+; results in a significant increase in CaV3.3 current in action potential clamp experiments, while CaV3.1 and CaV3.2 currents are significantly reduced. In neuroblastoma NG 108-15 cells, the duration of CaV3.3-mediated action potentials is increased upon Zn2+; application, indicating further that Zn2+; behaves as a CaV3.3 channel opener. These results demonstrate that Zn2+; exhibits differential modulatory effects on T-type calcium channels, which may partly explain the complex features of Zn2+; modulation of the neuronal excitability in normal and disease states. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.

abstract = {Phosphorylation is a major mechanism regulating the activity of ion channels that remains poorly understood with respect to T-type calcium channels (Cav3). These channels are low voltage-activated calcium channels that play a key role in cellular excitability and various physiological functions. Their dysfunction has been linked to several neurological disorders, including absence epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Recent studies have revealed that T-type channels are modulated by a variety of serine/threonine protein kinase pathways, which indicates the need for a systematic analysis of T-type channel phosphorylation. Here, we immunopurified Cav3.2 channels from rat brain, and we used high-resolution MS to construct the first, to our knowledge, in vivo phosphorylation map of a voltage-gated calcium channel in a mammalian brain. We identified as many as 34 phosphorylation sites, and we show that the vast majority of these sites are also phosphorylated on the human Cav3.2 expressed in HEK293T cells. In patch-clamp studies, treatment of the channel with alkaline phosphatase as well as analysis of dephosphomimetic mutants revealed that phosphorylation regulates important functional properties of Cav3.2 channels, including voltage-dependent activation and inactivation and kinetics. We also identified that the phosphorylation of a locus situated in the loop I-II S442/S445/T446 is crucial for this regulation. Our data show that Cav3.2 channels are highly phosphorylated in the mammalian brain and establish phosphorylation as an important mechanism involved in the dynamic regulation of Cav3.2 channel gating properties.},

abstract = {As T-type calcium channels open near resting membrane potential and markedly influence neuronal excitability their activity needs to be tightly regulated. Few neuronal T-current regulations have been described so far, but interestingly some of them involve unusual mechanisms like G protein-independent but receptor-coupled modulation, while the use of recombinant channels has established both a direct action of Gbetagamma subunits, anandamide, arachidonic acid and a phosphorylation process by CaMKII. Nearly all reported types of modulation involve Cav3.2 channels while no regulation of Cav3.1 has been reported, a difference that may originate from diversities in the intracellular loop connecting the II and III domains of the two isotypes. The search for T-current regulators requires taking into account their peculiar activation properties, since a close link may exist between the channel conformation and its modulation. Indeed, in thalamocortical neurons a phosphorylation-mediated regulation of the amplitude of the T-current has been shown to be highly dependent upon the state of the channel and only to become apparent when the channels are in the voltage range close to neuronal resting membrane potential.},
