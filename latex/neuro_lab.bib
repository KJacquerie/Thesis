	abstract = {Chemical synapses are not static transmitters of information. Their effectiveness waxes and wanes depending upon factors such as the frequency of stimulation and prior activity. The ability of synapses to change their strength, called synaptic plasticity, is critical not only for regulating the flow of information within neuronal circuits, but also for learning and memory. In homosynaptic plasticity, the strength of a synapse is changed as a consequence of activity in that synapse. In heterosynaptic plasticity, the strength of a synapse changes as a result of activity in a neuron or pathway extrinsic to that synapse. Both can occur over a wide range of temporal domains. Short-term plasticity refers to changes in synaptic strength that persist for seconds to minutes. Long-term plasticity refers to changes in synaptic strength that persist for hours, days to lifetimes. In this chapter, we consider the mechanisms that underlie short-term and long-term plasticity of chemical synapses.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0086248},
	abstract = {It is widely accepted that the direction and magnitude of synaptic plasticity depends on post-synaptic calcium flux, where high levels of calcium lead to long-term potentiation and moderate levels lead to long-term depression. At synapses onto neurons in region CA1 of the hippocampus (and many other synapses), NMDA receptors provide the relevant source of calcium. In this regard, post-synaptic calcium captures the coincidence of pre- and post-synaptic activity, due to the blockage of these receptors at low voltage. Previous studies show that under spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) protocols, potentiation at CA1 synapses requires post-synaptic bursting and an inter-pairing frequency in the range of the hippocampal theta rhythm. We hypothesize that these requirements reflect the saturation of the mechanisms of calcium extrusion from the post-synaptic spine. We test this hypothesis with a minimal model of NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity, simulating slow extrusion with a calcium-dependent calcium time constant. In simulations of STDP experiments, the model accounts for latency-dependent depression with either post-synaptic bursting or theta-frequency pairing (or neither) and accounts for latency-dependent potentiation when both of these requirements are met. The model makes testable predictions for STDP experiments and our simple implementation is tractable at the network level, demonstrating associative learning in a biophysical network model with realistic synaptic dynamics. © 2014 Standage et al.},

Research on the neurobiology of sleep and the mechanisms of long-term synaptic plasticity has provided data in support of various theories of how brain activity during sleep affects long-term synaptic plasticity. The experimental findings – and therefore the theories – are apparently quite contradictory, with some evidence pointing to a role of sleep in the forgetting of irrelevant memories, whereas other results indicate that sleep supports the reinforcement of the most valuable recollections. A unified theoretical framework is in need. Computational modeling and simulation provide grounds for the quantitative testing and comparison of theoretical predictions and observed data, and might serve as a strategy to organize the rather complicated and diverse pool of data and methodologies used in sleep research. This review article outlines the emerging progress in the computational modeling and simulation of the main theories on the role of sleep in memory consolidation.},

Brain states reliably switch between distinct spatiotemporal signatures at a network scale even though they are composed of heterogeneous and variable rhythms at a cellular scale. We investigated the mechanisms of this network control in a conductance-based population model that reliably switches between active and oscillatory mean-fields. Robust control of the mean-field properties relies critically on a switchable negative intrinsic conductance at the cellular level. This conductance endows circuits with a shared cellular positive feedback that can switch population rhythms on and off at a cellular resolution. The switch is largely independent from other intrinsic neuronal properties, network size and synaptic connectivity. It is therefore compatible with the temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity induced by slower regulatory functions such as neuromodulation, synaptic plasticity and homeostasis. Strikingly, the required cellular mechanism is available in all cell types that possess T-type calcium channels but unavailable in computational models that neglect the slow kinetics of their activation.},

Unfortunately, those paired-based STDP models cannot account for the dependence on the repetition frequency of the pairs of spike. Moreover, those STDP models cannot reproduce recent triplet and quadruplet experiments. Here, we examine a triplet rule (i.e., a rule which considers sets of three spikes, i.e., two pre and one post or one pre and two post) and compare it to classical pair-based STDP learning rules. With such a triplet rule, it is possible to fit experimental data from visual cortical slices as well as from hippocampal cultures.

	doi = {10.3389/fncir.2017.00061},
	abstract = {Research findings over the past two decades have supported a link between sleep states and synaptic plasticity. Numerous mechanistic hypotheses have been put forth to explain this relationship. For example, multiple studies have shown structural alterations to synapses (including changes in synaptic volume, spine density, and receptor composition) indicative of synaptic weakening after a period of sleep. Direct measures of neuronal activity and synaptic strength support the idea that a period of sleep can reduce synaptic strength. This has led to the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY), which asserts that during slow wave sleep, synapses are downscaled throughout the brain to counteract net strengthening of network synapses during waking experience (e.g., during learning). However, neither the cellularmechanismsmediating these synaptic changes, nor the sleep-dependent activity changes driving those cellular events are well-defined. Here we discuss potential cellular and network dynamicmechanisms which could underlie reductions in synaptic strength during sleep. We also discuss recent findings demonstrating circuit-specific synaptic strengthening (rather than weakening) during sleep. Based on these data, we explore the hypothetical role of sleep-associated network activity patterns in driving synaptic strengthening. We propose an alternative to SHY—namely that depending on experience during prior wake, a variety of plasticity mechanisms may operate in the brain during sleep. We conclude that either synaptic strengthening or synaptic weakening can occur across sleep, depending on changes to specific neural circuits (such as gene expression and protein translation) induced by experiences in wake. Clarifying the mechanisms underlying these different forms of sleep-dependent plasticity will significantly advance our understanding of how sleep benefits various cognitive functions.},

	abstract = {Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is critical for cortical circuit refinement. The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis suggests that synaptic connections are strengthened during wake and downscaled during sleep; however, it is not obvious how the same plasticity rules could explain both outcomes. Using whole-cell recordings and optogenetic stimulation of presynaptic input in urethane-anesthetized mice, which exhibit slow-wave-sleep (SWS)-like activity, we show that synaptic plasticity rules are gated by cortical dynamics in vivo. While Down states support conventional spike timing-dependent plasticity, Up states are biased toward depression such that presynaptic stimulation alone leads to synaptic depression, while connections contributing to postsynaptic spiking are protected against this synaptic weakening. We find that this novel activity-dependent and input-specific downscaling mechanism has two important computational advantages: (1) improved signal-to-noise ratio, and (2) preservation of previously stored information. Thus, these synaptic plasticity rules provide an attractive mechanism for SWS-related synaptic downscaling and circuit refinement. González-Rueda et al. show that presynaptic activation during slow-wave-sleep-like activity in vivo causes synaptic depression, unless it contributes to postsynaptic spiking. This plasticity rule offers an attractive mechanism for circuit refinement that improves signal-to-noise ratio and preserves previously stored information.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000618},
	abstract = {Spontaneous retinal activity (known as "waves") remodels synaptic connectivity to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) during development. Analysis of retinal waves recorded with multielectrode arrays in mouse suggested that a cue for the segregation of functionally distinct (ON and OFF) retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the LGN may be a desynchronization in their firing, where ON cells precede OFF cells by one second. Using the recorded retinal waves as input, with two different modeling approaches we explore timing-based plasticity rules for the evolution of synaptic weights to identify key features underlying ON/OFF segregation. First, we analytically derive a linear model for the evolution of ON and OFF weights, to understand how synaptic plasticity rules extract input firing properties to guide segregation. Second, we simulate postsynaptic activity with a nonlinear integrate-and-fire model to compare findings with the linear model. We find that spike-time-dependent plasticity, which modifies synaptic weights based on millisecond-long timing and order of pre- and postsynaptic spikes, fails to segregate ON and OFF retinal inputs in the absence of normalization. Implementing homeostatic mechanisms results in segregation, but only with carefully-tuned parameters. Furthermore, extending spike integration timescales to match the second-long input correlation timescales always leads to ON segregation because ON cells fire before OFF cells. We show that burst-time-dependent plasticity can robustly guide ON/OFF segregation in the LGN without normalization, by integrating pre- and postsynaptic bursts irrespective of their firing order and over second-long timescales. We predict that an LGN neuron will become ON- or OFF-responsive based on a local competition of the firing patterns of neighboring RGCs connecting to it. Finally, we demonstrate consistency with ON/OFF segregation in ferret, despite differences in the firing properties of retinal waves. Our model suggests that diverse input statistics of retinal waves can be robustly interpreted by a burst-based rule, which underlies retinogeniculate plasticity across different species. © 2009 Gjorgjieva et al.},

Specific alterations in the interactions between these cells can result in the generation of paroxysmal events resembling absence seizures in children. The release of several different neurotransmitters from the brain stem, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, and cerebral cortex results in a depolarization of thalamocortical and thalamic reticular neurons and an enhanced excitability in many cortical pyramidal cells, thereby suppressing the generation of sleep rhythms and promoting a state that is conducive to sensory processing and cognition.},

To investigate synaptic changes elicited by in vivo-like firing, we used numerical simulations and mathematical analysis of synaptic plasticity models. We found that the influence of spike timing on plasticity is weaker than expected from regular stimulation protocols. Moreover, when neurons fire irregularly, synaptic changes induced by precise spike timing can be equivalently induced by a modest firing rate variation.

	doi = {10.1152/jn.00593.2010},
	abstract = {Recent evidence indicates that net synaptic strength in cortical and other networks increases during wakefulness and returns to a baseline level during sleep. These homeostatic changes in synaptic strength are accompanied by corresponding changes in sleep slow wave activity (SWA) and in neuronal firing rates and synchrony. Other evidence indicates that sleep is associated with an initial reactivation of learned firing patterns that decreases over time. Finally, sleep can enhance performance of learned tasks, aid memory consolidation, and desaturate the ability to learn. Using a large-scale model of the corticothalamic system equipped with a spike-timing dependent learning rule, in agreement with experimental results, we demonstrate a net increase in synaptic strength in the waking mode associated with an increase in neuronal firing rates and synchrony. In the sleep mode, net synaptic strength decreases accompanied by a decline in SWA. We show that the interplay of activity and plasticity changes implements a control loop yielding an exponential, self-limiting renormalization of synaptic strength. Moreover, when the model "learns" a sequence of activation during waking, the learned sequence is preferentially reactivated during sleep, and reactivation declines over time. Finally, sleepdependent synaptic renormalization leads to increased signal-to-noise ratios, increased resistance to interference, and desaturation of learning capabilities. Although the specific mechanisms implemented in the model cannot capture the variety and complexity of biological substrates, and will need modifications in line with future evidence, the present simulations provide a unified, parsimonious account for diverse experimental findings coming from molecular, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches.

Evidence for sleep-dependent synaptic downscaling (or synaptic renormalization) has been observed experimentally, but the physiological mechanisms which generate this phenomenon are unknown. In this study, we propose that changes in neuronal membrane excitability induced by acetylcholine may provide a dynamical mechanism for both wake-dependent synaptic upscaling and sleep-dependent downscaling. We show in silico that cholinergically-induced changes in network firing patterns alter overall network synaptic potentiation when synaptic strengths evolve through spike-timing dependent plasticity mechanisms. Specifically, network synaptic potentiation increases dramatically with high cholinergic concentration and decreases dramatically with low levels of acetylcholine. We demonstrate that this phenomenon is robust across variation of many different network parameters. © 2013 Fink et al.},

	abstract = {We review a body of theoretical and experimental research on Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity, starting from a puzzling observation: while homeostasis of synapses found in experiments is a slow compensatory process, most mathematical models of synaptic plasticity use rapid compensatory processes (RCPs). Even worse, with the slow homeostatic plasticity reported in experiments, simulations of existing plasticity models cannot maintain network stability unless further control mechanisms are implemented. To solve this paradox, we suggest that in addition to slow forms of homeostatic plasticity there are RCPs which stabilize synaptic plasticity on short timescales. These rapid processes may include heterosynaptic depression triggered by episodes of high postsynaptic firing rate. While slower forms of homeostatic plasticity are not sufficient to stabilize Hebbian plasticity, they are important for fine-tuning neural circuits. Taken together we suggest that learning and memory rely on an intricate interplay of diverse plasticity mechanisms on different timescales which jointly ensure stability and plasticity of neural circuits.},

In the model, assemblies were formed during repeated sensory stimulation and characterized by strong recurrent excitatory connections. Even days after formation, and despite ongoing network activity and synaptic plasticity, memories could be recalled through selective delay activity following the brief stimulation of a subset of assembly neurons. Blocking any component of plasticity prevented stable functioning as a memory network. Our modelling results suggest that the diversity of plasticity phenomena in the brain is orchestrated towards achieving common functional goals.},

	abstract = {Fifty years ago, FitzHugh introduced a phase portrait that became famous for a twofold reason: it captured in a physiological way the qualitative behavior of Hodgkin-Huxley model and it revealed the power of simple dynamical models to unfold complex firing patterns. To date, in spite of the enormous progresses in qualitative and quantitative neural modeling, this phase portrait has remained a core picture of neuronal excitability. Yet, a major difference between the neurophysiology of 1961 and of 2011 is the recognition of the prominent role of calcium channels in firing mechanisms. We show that including this extra current in Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics leads to a revision of FitzHugh-Nagumo phase portrait that affects in a fundamental way the reduced modeling of neural excitability. The revisited model considerably enlarges the modeling power of the original one. In particular, it captures essential electrophysiological signatures that otherwise require non-physiological alteration or considerable complexification of the classical model. As a basic illustration, the new model is shown to highlight a core dynamical mechanism by which calcium channels control the two distinct firing modes of thalamocortical neurons. © 2012 Drion et al.},

During rest periods, such as may occur during sleep, the assemblies reactivate spontaneously, reinforcing memories against ongoing synapse removal and replacement. Brief daily reactivations during rest- periods suffice to not only maintain the assemblies, but even strengthen them, and improve pattern completion, consistent with offline memory gains observed experimentally. While the connectivity inside memory representations is strengthened during rest phases, connections in the rest of the network decay and vanish thus reconciling apparently conflicting hypotheses of the influence of sleep on cortical connectivity.},

The resulting BTDP exhibits exponential decays with the same time scales as those of STDP. In weakly coupled bursting neuron networks, the synaptic modification driven by the spike-burst activity obeys a power-law distribution.

	abstract = {Synaptic strength depresses for low and potentiates for high activation of the postsynaptic neuron. This feature is a key property of the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) synaptic learning rule, which has been shown tomaximize the selectivity of the postsynaptic neuron, and thereby offers a possible explanation for experience-dependent cortical plasticity such as orientation selectivity. However, the BCM framework is rate-based and a significant amount of recent work has shown that synaptic plasticity also depends on the precise timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes. Here we consider a triplet model of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) that depends on the interactions of three precisely timed spikes. Triplet STDP has been shown to describe plasticity experiments that the classical STDP rule, based on pairs of spikes, has failed to capture. In the case of rate-based patterns, we show a tight correspondence between the triplet STDP rule and the BCM rule. We analytically demonstrate the selectivity property of the triplet STDP rule for orthogonal inputs and perform numerical simulations for nonorthogonal inputs. Moreover, in contrast to BCM, we show that triplet STDP can also induce selectivity for input patterns consisting of higher-order spatiotemporal correlations, which exist in natural stimuli and have been measured in the brain. We show that this sensitivity to higher-order correlations can be used to develop direction and speed selectivity.},

	abstract = {Synaptic transmission is a dynamic process. Postsynaptic responses wax and wane as presynaptic activity evolves. This prominent characteristic of chemical synaptic transmission is a crucial determinant of the response properties of synapses and, in turn, of the stimulus properties selected by neural networks and of the patterns of activity generated by those networks. This review focuses on synaptic changes that result from prior activity in the synapse under study, and is restricted to short-term effects that last for at most a few minutes. Forms of synaptic enhancement, such as facilitation, augmentation, and post-tetanic potentiation, are usually attributed to effects of a residual elevation in presynaptic [Ca2+]i, acting on one or more molecular targets that appear to be distinct from the secretory trigger responsible for fast exocytosis and phasic release of transmitter to single action potentials. We discuss the evidence for this hypothesis, and the origins of the different kinetic phases of synaptic enhancement, as well as the interpretation of statistical changes in transmitter release and roles played by other factors such as alterations in presynaptic Ca2+ influx or postsynaptic levels of [Ca2+]i. Synaptic depression dominates enhancement at many synapses. Depression is usually attributed to depletion of some pool of readily releasable vesicles, and various forms of the depletion model are discussed. Depression can also arise from feedback activation of presynaptic receptors and from postsynaptic processes such as receptor desensitization. In addition, glial-neuronal interactions can contribute to short-term synaptic plasticity. Finally, we summarize the recent literature on putative molecular players in synaptic plasticity and the effects of genetic manipulations and other modulatory influences.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004750},
	abstract = {Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is a widespread plasticity mechanism in the nervous system. The simplest description of STDP only takes into account pairs of pre- and postsynaptic spikes, with potentiation of the synapse when a presynaptic spike precedes a postsynaptic spike and depression otherwise. In light of experiments that explored a variety of spike patterns, the pair-based STDP model has been augmented to account for multiple pre- and postsynaptic spike interactions. As a result, a number of different “multi-spike” STDP models have been proposed based on different experimental observations. The behavior of these models at the population level is crucial for understanding mechanisms of learning and memory. The challenging balance between the stability of a population of synapses and their competitive modification is well studied for pair-based models, but it has not yet been fully analyzed for multi-spike models. Here, we address this issue through numerical simulations of an integrate-and-fire model neuron with excitatory synapses subject to STDP described by three different proposed multi-spike models. We also analytically calculate average synaptic changes and fluctuations about these averages. Our results indicate that the different multi-spike models behave quite differently at the population level. Although each model can produce synaptic competition in certain parameter regions, none of them induces synaptic competition with its originally fitted parameters. The dichotomy between synaptic stability and Hebbian competition, which is well characterized for pair-based STDP models, persists in multi-spike models. However, anti-Hebbian competition can coexist with synaptic stability in some models. We propose that the collective behavior of synaptic plasticity models at the population level should be used as an additional guideline in applying phenomenological models based on observations of single synapses.},

It is shown that all of the above formulations can be derived from the point of view of an expansion. In the absence of BPAPs, it is natural to correlate presynaptic spikes with the postsynaptic membrane potential. Time windows of spike-time-dependent plasticity arise naturally if the timing of postsynaptic spikes is available at the site of the synapse, as is the case in the presence of BPAPs.

Depression can cancel previously activated potentiation, whereas potentiation tends to override previously activated depression. The time window for potentiation to dominate is about 70 ms, beyond which the two processes cancel.

To investigate synaptic changes elicited by in vivo-like firing, we used numerical simulations and mathematical analysis of synaptic plasticity models. We found that the influence of spike timing on plasticity is weaker than expected from regular stimulation protocols. Moreover, when neurons fire irregularly, synaptic changes induced by precise spike timing can be equivalently induced by a modest firing rate variation. Our findings bridge the gap between existing results on synaptic plasticity and plasticity occurring in vivo, and challenge the dominant role of spike timing in plasticity.},

Second, the necessary degree of coherence in the signal arrival times can be attained during ontogenetic development by virtue of an unsupervised hebbian learning role. Learning selects connections with matching delays from a broad distribution of axons with random delays. Third, the learning role also selects the correct delays from two independent groups of inputs, for example, from the left and right ear.},

Sleep is known to be beneficial to cognitive and mnemonic tasks, while chronic sleep deprivation is detrimental. Despite the importance of the phenomenon, a complete understanding of its functions and underlying mechanisms is still lacking. In this paper, we show interesting effects of deep-sleep-like slow oscillation activity on a simplified thalamo-cortical model which is trained to encode, retrieve and classify images of handwritten digits. During slow oscillations, spike-timing-dependent-plasticity (STDP) produces a differential homeostatic process. It is characterized by both a specific unsupervised enhancement of connections among groups of neurons associated to instances of the same class (digit) and a simultaneous down-regulation of stronger synapses created by the training. This hierarchical organization of post-sleep internal representations favours higher performances in retrieval and classification tasks. The mechanism is based on the interaction between top-down cortico-thalamic predictions and bottom-up thalamo-cortical projections during deep-sleep-like slow oscillations. Indeed, when learned patterns are replayed during sleep, cortico-thalamo-cortical connections favour the activation of other neurons coding for similar thalamic inputs, promoting their association. Such mechanism hints at possible applications to artificial learning systems.},

	abstract = {As neuromodulation therapy has grown, so has the recognition that computational models can provide important insights into the design, operation, and clinical application of neurostimulation systems. Models of deep brain stimulation and spinal cord stimulation have advanced over recent decades from simple, stereotyped models to sophisticated patient-specific models that can incorporate many important details of the stimulation system and the attributes of individual subjects. Models have been used to make detailed predictions of the bioelectric fields produced during stimulation. These predictions have been used as a starting point for further analyses such as stimulation safety, neural response, neurostimulation system design, or clinical outcomes.

	abstract = {In spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) change in synaptic strength depends on the timing of pre-vs. postsynaptic spiking activity. Since STDP is in compliance with Hebb’s postulate, it is considered one of the major mechanisms of memory storage and recall. STDP comprises a system of two coincidence detectors with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation often posited as one of the main components. Numerous studies have unveiled a third component of this coincidence detection system, namely neuromodulation and glia activity shaping STDP. Even though dopaminergic control of STDP has most often been reported, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, nitric oxide (NO), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) also has been shown to effectively modulate STDP. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that astrocytes, via the release or uptake of glutamate, gate STDP expression. At the most fundamental level, the timing properties of STDP are expected to depend on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the underlying signaling pathways. However in most cases, due to technical limitations experiments grant only indirect access to these pathways. Computational models carefully constrained by experiments, allow for a better qualitative understanding of the molecular basis of STDP and its regulation by neuromodulators. Recently, computational models of calcium dynamics and signaling pathway molecules have started to explore STDP emergence in ex and in vivo-like conditions. These models are expected to reproduce better at least part of the complex modulation of STDP as an emergent property of the underlying molecular pathways. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying STDP modulation and its consequences on network dynamics is of critical importance and will allow better understanding of the major mechanisms of memory storage and recall both in health and disease.},

	abstract = {In cultures of dissociated rat hippocampal neurons, persistent potentiation and depression of glutamatergic synapses were induced by correlated spiking of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The relative timing between the presynaptic and postsynaptic spiking determined the direction and the extent of synaptic changes. Repetitive postsynaptic spiking within a time window of 20 msec after presynaptic activation resulted in long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas postsynaptic spiking within a window of 20 msec before the repetitive presynaptic activation led to long-term depression (LTD). Significant LTP occurred only at synapses with relatively low initial strength, whereas the extent of LTD did not show obvious dependence on the initial synaptic strength. Both LTP and LTD depended on the activation of NMDA receptors and were absent in cases in which the postsynaptic neurons were GABAergic in nature. Blockade of L-type calcium channels with nimodipine abolished the induction of LTD and reduced the extent of LTP. These results underscore the importance of precise spike timing, synaptic strength, and postsynaptic cell type in the activity- induced modification of central synapses and suggest that Hebb's rule may need to incorporate a quantitative consideration of spike timing that reflects the narrow and asymmetric window for the induction of synaptic modification.},

Here, we employ computational modelling to further characterize the effects of cholinergic depression on behaviour. We find that acetylcholine, by allowing learning from negative outcomes, enhances exploration over the action space. We show that this results in a variety of effects, depending on the structure of the model, the environment and the task.

Compared with burst mode, geniculate relay cells that are firing in tonic mode exhibit better linear summation, but have poorer detectability for visual stimuli. The switch between the response modes can be controlled by nonretinal, modulatory afferents to these cells, such as the feedback pathway from cortex.

At depolarized membrane potentials, thalamic cells fire single action potentials and faithfully relay synaptic inputs to the cortex. At hyperpolarized potentials, the activation of T-type calcium channels promotes burst firing, and the transfer is less accurate. Our results suggest that this duality no longer holds if synaptic background activity is taken into account. By injecting stochastic conductances into guinea-pig thalamocortical neurons in slices, we show that the transfer function of these neurons is strongly influenced by conductance noise. The combination of synaptic noise with intrinsic properties gives a global responsiveness that is more linear, mixing single-spike and burst responses at all membrane potentials. Because in thalamic neurons, background synaptic input originates mainly from cortex, these results support a determinant role of corticothalamic feedback during sensory information processing. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group.},

What has not been addressed theoretically or experimentally is whether STP is "learned"; that is, is STP regulated by specific learning rules that are in place to optimize the computations performed at synapses, or, are changes in STP essentially an epiphenomenon of long-term plasticity? Here we propose that STP is governed by specific learning rules that operate independently and in parallel of the associative learning rules governing baseline synaptic strength. We describe a learning rule for STP and, using simulations, demonstrate that it significantly enhances the discrimination of spatiotemporal stimuli. Additionally we generate a set of experimental predictions aimed at testing our hypothesis. © 2011 Carvalho and Buonomano.},

Indeed, the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD) is associated with the enlargement or shrinkage of the spine, respectively. This structural plasticity is mainly controlled by actin filaments, the principal cytoskeletal component of the spine.

Our model has a Hodgkin-Huxley conductance-based neuron with AMPA and NMDA channels and voltage-gated calcium channels in addition to the usual currents. The time course of intracellular concentration of Ca2+ is determined by fluxes from these three sources and drives a competition of kinase and phosphatase pathways. Our critical assumption is a phenomenological form for the competition of kinase and phosphatase activity leading to changes in synaptic strength. This is examined in the context of experiments that induce plasticity by programmed postsynaptic intracellular Ca2+ release. It is successful in describing such experiments. This connection is used in conjunction with a biophysical model of postsynaptic membrane voltage and Ca2+ fluxes to show that the features of the other protocols are consequences of the model. We then use the model to predict the outcome of new experiments: (a) LTP/LTD spike timing plasticity in the presence of varying extracellular concentrations of Mg2+, (b) the response of synaptic strength to the presentation of concurrent presynaptic and postsynaptic spike trains, and (c) spike timing plasticity with two presynaptic (postsynaptic) spikes and one postsynaptic (presynaptic) spike.},

	abstract = {An open question within the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro theory for synaptic modification concerns the specific mechanism that is responsible for regulating the sliding modification threshold (SMT). In this conductance-based modeling study on hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we quantitatively assessed the impact of seven ion channels (R- and T-type calcium, fast sodium, delayed rectifier,A-type, and small-conductance calcium-activated (SK) potassium and HCN) and two receptors (AMPAR and NMDAR) on a calcium-dependent Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro-like plasticity rule. Our analysis with R- and T-type calcium channels revealed that differences in their activation-inactivation profiles resulted in differential impacts on how they altered the SMT. Further, we found that the impact of SK channels on the SMT critically depended on the voltage dependence and kinetics of the calcium sources with which they interacted. Next, we considered interactions among all the seven channels and the two receptors through global sensitivity analysis on 11 model parameters. We constructed 20,000 models through uniform randomization of these parameters and found 360 valid models based on experimental constraints on their plasticity profiles. Analyzing these 360 models, we found that similar plasticity profiles could emerge with several nonunique parametric combinations and that parameters exhibited weak pairwise correlations. Finally, we used seven sets of virtual knock-outs on these 360 models and found that the impact of different channels on the SMT was variable and differential. These results suggest that there are several nonunique routes to regulate the SMT, and call for a systematic analysis of the variability and state dependence of the mechanisms underlying metaplasticity during behavior and pathology.},

It has been demonstrated that changes in synaptic conductance can be induced by approximately synchronous pairings of pre- and post- synaptic action potentials delivered at low frequencies. It has also been established that NMDAr-dependent calcium influx into dendritic spines represents a critical signal for plasticity induction, and can account for this spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) as well as experimental data obtained using other stimulation protocols. However, subsequent empirical studies have delineated a more complex relationship between spiketiming, firing rate, stimulus duration and post-synaptic bursting in dictating changes in the conductance of hippocampal excitatory synapses. Here, we present a detailed biophysical model of single dendritic spines on a CA1 pyramidal neuron, describe the NMDAr-dependent calcium influx generated by different stimulation protocols, and construct a parsimonious model of calcium driven kinase and phosphatase dynamics that dictate the probability of stochastic transitions between binary synaptic weight states in a Markov model. We subsequently demonstrate that this approach can account for a range of empirical observations regarding the dynamics of synaptic plasticity induced by different stimulation protocols, under regimes of pharmacological blockade and metaplasticity. Finally, we highlight the strengths and weaknesses of this parsimonious, unified computational synaptic plasticity model, discuss differences between the properties of cortical and hippocampal plasticity highlighted by the experimental literature, and the manner in which further empirical and theoretical research might elucidate the cellular basis of mammalian learning and memory function. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

Recent findings suggest an unanticipated degree of structural organization at the synapse, and improved methods in cellular imaging of living tissue have provided much-needed information about the intracellular dynamics of Ca2+, thought to be critical for both LTP and LTD.

The magnitude of [Ca2+] increase caused by NMDA-receptor (NMDAR) and voltage-gated Ca2+ -channel (VGCC) activation is thought to determine both the amplitude and direction of synaptic plasticity by differential activation of Ca2+ -sensitive enzymes such as calmodulin. Ca2+ influx is negatively regulated by Ca2+ -activated K+ channels (SK-channels) which are in turn inhibited by neuromodulators such as acetylcholine. However, the precise mechanisms by which SK-channels control the induction of synaptic plasticity remain unclear. Using a 3-dimensional model of Ca2+ and calmodulin dynamics within an idealised, but biophysically-plausible, dendritic spine, we show that SK-channels regulate calmodulin activation specifically during neuron-firing patterns associated with induction of spike timing-dependent plasticity. SK-channel activation and the subsequent reduction in Ca2+ influx through NMDARs and L-type VGCCs results in an order of magnitude decrease in calmodulin (CaM) activation, providing a mechanism for the effective gating of synaptic plasticity induction.

Recent physiological data have shown that the precise relative timings of pre- and post-synaptic neuron firings at a synapse determine both the direction of certain types of modification (potentiation or depression), and magnitude of this modification. We propose a neurophysiological mechanism by which this spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP) could arise, and support this hypothesis using a model involving calcium dynamics. We show that, in addition to reproducing experimental data for paired spikes, the model can explain differences in experimentally observed STDP forms. We also demonstrate that the model provides a good match to recent data for the triplet and quadruplet paradigms, and that a simulated network of reciprocally connected neurons using this learning rule can store and recall a simple temporal sequence. In conclusion we make predictions from the model both on the plasticity effects of quadruple spike interactions and manipulations of concentrations of components involved at the synapse. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Theoretical and computational frameworks for synaptic plasticity and learning have a long and cherished history, with few parallels within the well-established literature for plasticity of voltage-gated ion channels. In this study, we derive rules for plasticity in the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, and assess the synergy between synaptic and HCN channel plasticity in establishing stability during synaptic learning. To do this, we employ a conductance-based model for the hippocampal pyramidal neuron, and incorporate synaptic plasticity through the well-established Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM)-like rule for synaptic plasticity, wherein the direction and strength of the plasticity is dependent on the concentration of calcium influx. Under this framework, we derive a rule for HCN channel plasticity to establish homeostasis in synaptically-driven firing rate, and incorporate such plasticity into our model. In demonstrating that this rule for HCN channel plasticity helps maintain firing rate homeostasis after bidirectional synaptic plasticity, we observe a linear relationship between synaptic plasticity and HCN channel plasticity for maintaining firing rate homeostasis. Motivated by this linear relationship, we derive a calcium-dependent rule for HCN-channel plasticity, and demonstrate that firing rate homeostasis is maintained in the face of synaptic plasticity when moderate and high levels of cytosolic calcium influx induced depression and potentiation of the HCN-channel conductance, respectively. Additionally, we show that such synergy between synaptic and HCN-channel plasticity enhances the stability of synaptic learning through metaplasticity in the BCM-like synaptic plasticity profile. Finally, we demonstrate that the synergistic interaction between synaptic and HCN-channel plasticity preserves robustness of information transfer across the neuron under a rate-coding schema. Our results establish specific physiological roles for experimentally observed plasticity in HCN channels accompanying synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons, and uncover potential links between HCN-channel plasticity and calcium influx, dynamic gain control and stable synaptic learning. © 2013 Honnuraiah, Narayanan.},

	abstract = {Finding the rules underlying how axons of cortical neurons form neural circuits and modify their corresponding synaptic strength is the still subject of intense research. Experiments have shown that internal calcium concentration, and both the precise timing and temporal order of pre and postsynaptic action potentials, are important constituents governing whether the strength of a synapse located on the dendrite is increased or decreased. In particular, previous investigations focusing on spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) have typically observed an asymmetric temporal window governing changes in synaptic efficacy. Such a temporal window emphasizes that if a presynaptic spike, arriving at the synaptic terminal, precedes the generation of a postsynaptic action potential, then the synapse is potentiated; however if the temporal order is reversed, then depression occurs. Furthermore, recent experimental studies have now demonstrated that the temporal window also depends on the dendritic location of the synapse. Specifically, it was shown that in distal regions of the apical dendrite, the magnitude of potentiation was smaller and the window for depression was broader, when compared to observations from the proximal region of the dendrite. To date, the underlying mechanism(s) for such a distance-dependent effect is (are) currently unknown. Here, using the ionic cable theory framework in conjunction with the standard calcium based plasticity model, we show for the first time that such distance-dependent inhomogeneities in the temporal learning window for STDP can be largely explained by both the spatial and active properties of the dendrite. © 2014 Iannella et al.},

Studies have shown that these inputs converge onto the medium spiny (MS) neurons of NAc where limbic cues are processed. Synaptic plasticity has been found to occur in the cortex-NAc as well as the hippocampus-NAc pathways. It has been suggested that similar to other central neurons, N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor mediated plasticity could form the basis of the learning process in NAc. Because of the tiny structure of MS neurons, experimental studies on the dendritic properties of these neurons are very sparse.

	abstract = {In spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), synapses exhibit LTD or LTP depending on the order of activity in the presynaptic and postsynaptic cells. LTP occurs when a single presynaptic spike precedes a postsynaptic one (a positive interspike interval, or ISI), while the reverse order of activity (a negative ISI) produces LTD. A fundamental question is whether the "standard model" of plasticity in which moderate increases in Ca2+ influx through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) channels induce LTD and large increases induce LTP, can account for the order and interval sensitivity of STDP. To examine this issue we developed a model that captures postsynaptic Ca2+ influx dynamics and the associativity of the NMDA receptors. While this model can generate both LTD and LTP, it predicts that LTD will be observed at both negative and positive ISIs. This is because longer and longer positive ISIs induce monotonically decreasing levels of Ca2+, which eventually fall into the same range that produced LTD at negative ISIs. A second model that incorporated a second coincidence detector in addition to the NMDA receptor generated LTP at positive intervals and LTD only at negative ones. Our findings suggest that a single coincidence detector model based on the standard model of plasticity cannot account for order-specific STDP, and we predict that STDP requires two coincidence detectors.},

	abstract = {The NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity is thought to mediate several forms of learning, and can be induced by spike trains containing a small number of spikes occurring with varying rates and timing, as well as with oscillations. We computed the influence of these variables on the plasticity induced at a single NMDAR containing synapse using a reduced model that was analytically tractable, and these findings were confirmed using detailed, multi-compartment model. In addition to explaining diverse experimental results about the rate and timing dependence of synaptic plasticity, the model made several novel and testable predictions. We found that there was a preferred frequency for inducing long-term potentiation (LTP) such that higher frequency stimuli induced lesser LTP, decreasing as 1/f when the number of spikes in the stimulus was kept fixed. Among other things, the preferred frequency for inducing LTP varied as a function of the distance of the synapse from the soma. In fact, same stimulation frequencies could induce LTP or long-term depression depending on the dendritic location of the synapse. Next, we found that rhythmic stimuli induced greater plasticity then irregular stimuli. Furthermore, brief bursts of spikes significantly expanded the timing dependence of plasticity. Finally, we found that in the ∼5-15-Hz frequency range both rateand timing-dependent plasticity mechanisms work synergistically to render the synaptic plasticity most sensitive to spike timing. These findings provide computational evidence that oscillations can have a profound influence on the plasticity of an NMDAR-dependent synapse, and show a novel role for the dendritic morphology in this process.},

Amongst others, by testing our framework by abstracting the dynamics of two well-established calcium-dependent synaptic plasticity models, we derived that the synaptic changes depend on the square of the presynaptic firing rate, which is in contrast to previous assumptions. Thus, the here-presented framework enables the derivation of biologically plausible but simple mathematical models of synaptic plasticity allowing to analyze the underlying dependencies of synaptic dynamics from neuronal properties such as the firing rate and to investigate their implications in complex neuronal networks.},

In order to maintain plasticity-induced changes for longer time scales (up to several days), they have to be consolidated by transferring them from a short-lasting early-phase to a long-lasting late-phase state. The underlying processes of this synaptic consolidation are already well-known for homosynaptic plasticity, however, it is not clear whether the same processes also enable the induction and consolidation of heterosynaptic plasticity. In this study, by extending a generic calcium-based plasticity model with the processes of synaptic consolidation, we show in simulations that indeed heterosynaptic plasticity can be induced and, furthermore, consolidated by the same underlying processes as for homosynaptic plasticity. Furthermore, we show that by local diffusion processes the heterosynaptic effect can be restricted to a few synapses neighboring the homosynaptically changed ones. Taken together, this generic model reproduces many experimental results of synaptic tagging and consolidation, provides several predictions for heterosynaptic induction and consolidation, and yields insights into the complex interactions between homo- and heterosynaptic plasticity over a broad variety of time (minutes to days) and spatial scales (several micrometers).},

	abstract = {Key points: Calcium (Ca2+) entry mediated by NMDA receptors is considered central to the induction of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in hippocampal area CA1; this description does not, however, take into account the potential contribution of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores. The ER has a heterogeneous distribution in CA1 dendritic spines, and may introduce localized functional differences in Ca2+ signalling between synapses, as suggested by experiments on metabotropic receptor-dependent long-term depression. A physiologically detailed computational model of Ca2+ dynamics at a CA3–CA1 excitatory synapse characterizes the contribution of spine ER via metabotropic signalling during plasticity induction protocols. ER Ca2+ release via IP3 receptors modulates NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity in a graded manner, to selectively promote synaptic depression with relatively diminished effect on LTP induction; this may temper further strengthening at the stronger synapses which are preferentially associated with ER-containing spines. Acquisition of spine ER may thus represent a local, biophysically plausible ‘metaplastic switch’ at potentiated CA1 synapses, contributing to the plasticity–stability balance in neural circuits. Abstract: Long-term plasticity mediated by NMDA receptors supports input-specific, Hebbian forms of learning at excitatory CA3–CA1 connections in the hippocampus. There exists an additional layer of stabilizing mechanisms that act globally as well as locally over multiple time scales to ensure that plasticity occurs in a constrained manner. Here, we investigated the role of calcium (Ca2+) stores associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the local regulation of plasticity at individual CA1 synapses. Our study was spurred by (1) the curious observation that ER is sparsely distributed in dendritic spines, but over-represented in larger spines that are likely to have undergone activity-dependent strengthening, and (2) evidence suggesting that ER motility at synapses can be rapid, and accompany activity-regulated spine remodelling. We constructed a physiologically realistic computational model of an ER-bearing CA1 spine, and examined how IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores affect spine Ca2+ dynamics during activity patterns mimicking the induction of long-term potentiation and long-term depression (LTD). Our results suggest that the presence of ER modulates NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity in a graded manner that selectively enhances LTD induction. We propose that ER may locally tune Ca2+-based plasticity, providing a braking mechanism to mitigate runaway strengthening at potentiated synapses. Our study provides a biophysically accurate description of postsynaptic Ca2+ regulation, and suggests that ER in the spine may promote the re-use of hippocampal synapses with saturated strengths.},

	abstract = {Corticostriatal synapse plasticity of medium spiny neurons is regulated by glutamate input from the cortex and dopamine input from the substantia nigra. While cortical stimulation alone results in long-term depression (LTD), the combination with dopamine switches LTD to long-term potentiation (LTP), which is known as dopamine-dependent plasticity. LTP is also induced by cortical stimulation in magnesium-free solution, which leads to massive calcium influx through NMDA-type receptors and is regarded as calcium-dependent plasticity. Signaling cascades in the corticostriatal spines are currently under investigation. However, because of the existence of multiple excitatory and inhibitory pathways with loops, the mechanisms regulating the two types of plasticity remain poorly understood. A signaling pathway model of spines that express D1-type dopamine receptors was constructed to analyze the dynamic mechanisms of dopamine- and calciumdependent plasticity. The model incorporated all major signaling molecules, including dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein with a molecular weight of 32 kDa (DARPP32), as well as AMPA receptor trafficking in the post-synaptic membrane. Simulations with dopamine and calcium inputs reproduced dopamine- and calcium-dependent plasticity. Further in silico experiments revealed that the positive feedback loop consisted of protein kinase A (PKA), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the phosphorylation site at threonine 75 of DARPP-32 (Thr75) served as the major switch for inducing LTD and LTP. Calcium input modulated this loop through the PP2B (phosphatase 2B)-CK1 (casein kinase 1)-Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5)-Thr75 pathway and PP2A, whereas calcium and dopamine input activated the loop via PKA activation by cyclic AMP (cAMP). The positive feedback loop displayed robust bi-stable responses following changes in the reaction parameters. Increased basal dopamine levels disrupted this dopamine-dependent plasticity. The present model elucidated the mechanisms involved in bidirectional regulation of corticostriatal synapses and will allow for further exploration into causes and therapies for dysfunctions such as drug addiction. © 2010 Nakano et al.},

	abstract = {Calcium has been proposed as a postsynaptic signal underlying synaptic spike-timing - dependent plasticity (STDP). We examine this hypothesis with computational modeling based on experimental results from hippocampal cultures, some of which are presented here, in which pairs and triplets of pre- and postsynaptic spikes induce potentiation and depression in a temporally asymmetric way. Specifically, we present a set of model biochemical detectors, based on plausible molecular pathways, which make direct use of the time course of the calcium signal to reproduce these experimental STDP results. Our model features a modular structure, in which long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) components compete to determine final plasticity outcomes; one aspect of this competition is a veto through which appropriate calcium time courses suppress LTD. Simulations of our model are also shown to be consistent with classical LTP and LTD induced by several presynaptic stimulation paradigms. Overall, our results provide computational evidence that, while the postsynaptic calcium time course contains sufficient information to distinguish various experimental long-term plasticity paradigms, small changes in the properties of back-propagation of action potentials or in synaptic dynamics can alter the calcium time course in ways that will significantly affect STDP induction by any detector based exclusively on postsynaptic calcium. This may account for the variability of STDP outcomes seen within hippocampal cultures, under repeated application of a single experimental protocol, as well as for that seen in multiple spike experiments across different systems.},

	abstract = {How do neurons reconcile the maintenance of calcium homeostasis with perpetual switches in patterns of afferent activity? Here, we assessed state-dependent evolution of calcium homeostasis in a population of hippocampal pyramidal neuron models, through an adaptation of a recent study on stomatogastric ganglion neurons. Calcium homeostasis was set to emerge through cell-autonomous updates to 12 ionic conductances, responding to different types of synaptically driven afferent activity. We first assessed the impact of theta-frequency inputs on the evolution of ionic conductances toward maintenance of calcium homeostasis. Although calcium homeostasis emerged efficaciously across all models in the population, disparate changes in ionic conductances that mediated this emergence resulted in variable plasticity to several intrinsic properties, also manifesting as significant differences in firing responses across models. Assessing the sensitivity of this form of plasticity, we noted that intrinsic neuronal properties and the firing response were sensitive to the target calcium concentration and to the strength and frequency of afferent activity. Next, we studied the evolution of calcium homeostasis when afferent activity was switched, in different temporal sequences, between two behaviorally distinct types of activity: theta-frequency inputs and sharp-wave ripples riding on largely silent periods. We found that the conductance values, intrinsic properties, and firing response of neurons exhibited differential robustness to an intervening switch in the type of afferent activity. These results unveil critical dissociations between different forms of homeostasis, and call for a systematic evaluation of the impact of state-dependent switches in afferent activity on neuronal intrinsic properties during neural coding and homeostasis.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0086248},
	abstract = {It is widely accepted that the direction and magnitude of synaptic plasticity depends on post-synaptic calcium flux, where high levels of calcium lead to long-term potentiation and moderate levels lead to long-term depression. At synapses onto neurons in region CA1 of the hippocampus (and many other synapses), NMDA receptors provide the relevant source of calcium. In this regard, post-synaptic calcium captures the coincidence of pre- and post-synaptic activity, due to the blockage of these receptors at low voltage. Previous studies show that under spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) protocols, potentiation at CA1 synapses requires post-synaptic bursting and an inter-pairing frequency in the range of the hippocampal theta rhythm. We hypothesize that these requirements reflect the saturation of the mechanisms of calcium extrusion from the post-synaptic spine. We test this hypothesis with a minimal model of NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity, simulating slow extrusion with a calcium-dependent calcium time constant. In simulations of STDP experiments, the model accounts for latency-dependent depression with either post-synaptic bursting or theta-frequency pairing (or neither) and accounts for latency-dependent potentiation when both of these requirements are met. The model makes testable predictions for STDP experiments and our simple implementation is tractable at the network level, demonstrating associative learning in a biophysical network model with realistic synaptic dynamics. © 2014 Standage et al.},

Our model has a Hodgkin-Huxley conductance-based neuron with AMPA and NMDA channels and voltage-gated calcium channels in addition to the usual currents. The time course of intracellular concentration of Ca2+ is determined by fluxes from these three sources and drives a competition of kinase and phosphatase pathways. Our critical assumption is a phenomenological form for the competition of kinase and phosphatase activity leading to changes in synaptic strength. This is examined in the context of experiments that induce plasticity by programmed postsynaptic intracellular Ca2+ release. It is successful in describing such experiments. This connection is used in conjunction with a biophysical model of postsynaptic membrane voltage and Ca2+ fluxes to show that the features of the other protocols are consequences of the model. We then use the model to predict the outcome of new experiments: (a) LTP/LTD spike timing plasticity in the presence of varying extracellular concentrations of Mg2+, (b) the response of synaptic strength to the presentation of concurrent presynaptic and postsynaptic spike trains, and (c) spike timing plasticity with two presynaptic (postsynaptic) spikes and one postsynaptic (presynaptic) spike.},

	abstract = {An open question within the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro theory for synaptic modification concerns the specific mechanism that is responsible for regulating the sliding modification threshold (SMT). In this conductance-based modeling study on hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we quantitatively assessed the impact of seven ion channels (R- and T-type calcium, fast sodium, delayed rectifier,A-type, and small-conductance calcium-activated (SK) potassium and HCN) and two receptors (AMPAR and NMDAR) on a calcium-dependent Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro-like plasticity rule. Our analysis with R- and T-type calcium channels revealed that differences in their activation-inactivation profiles resulted in differential impacts on how they altered the SMT. Further, we found that the impact of SK channels on the SMT critically depended on the voltage dependence and kinetics of the calcium sources with which they interacted. Next, we considered interactions among all the seven channels and the two receptors through global sensitivity analysis on 11 model parameters. We constructed 20,000 models through uniform randomization of these parameters and found 360 valid models based on experimental constraints on their plasticity profiles. Analyzing these 360 models, we found that similar plasticity profiles could emerge with several nonunique parametric combinations and that parameters exhibited weak pairwise correlations. Finally, we used seven sets of virtual knock-outs on these 360 models and found that the impact of different channels on the SMT was variable and differential. These results suggest that there are several nonunique routes to regulate the SMT, and call for a systematic analysis of the variability and state dependence of the mechanisms underlying metaplasticity during behavior and pathology.},

	abstract = {Synaptic plasticity is believed to represent the neural correlate of mammalian learning and memory function. It has been demonstrated that changes in synaptic conductance can be induced by approximately synchronous pairings of pre- and post- synaptic action potentials delivered at low frequencies. It has also been established that NMDAr-dependent calcium influx into dendritic spines represents a critical signal for plasticity induction, and can account for this spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) as well as experimental data obtained using other stimulation protocols. However, subsequent empirical studies have delineated a more complex relationship between spiketiming, firing rate, stimulus duration and post-synaptic bursting in dictating changes in the conductance of hippocampal excitatory synapses. Here, we present a detailed biophysical model of single dendritic spines on a CA1 pyramidal neuron, describe the NMDAr-dependent calcium influx generated by different stimulation protocols, and construct a parsimonious model of calcium driven kinase and phosphatase dynamics that dictate the probability of stochastic transitions between binary synaptic weight states in a Markov model. We subsequently demonstrate that this approach can account for a range of empirical observations regarding the dynamics of synaptic plasticity induced by different stimulation protocols, under regimes of pharmacological blockade and metaplasticity. Finally, we highlight the strengths and weaknesses of this parsimonious, unified computational synaptic plasticity model, discuss differences between the properties of cortical and hippocampal plasticity highlighted by the experimental literature, and the manner in which further empirical and theoretical research might elucidate the cellular basis of mammalian learning and memory function. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

Recent findings suggest an unanticipated degree of structural organization at the synapse, and improved methods in cellular imaging of living tissue have provided much-needed information about the intracellular dynamics of Ca2+, thought to be critical for both LTP and LTD.

The magnitude of [Ca2+] increase caused by NMDA-receptor (NMDAR) and voltage-gated Ca2+ -channel (VGCC) activation is thought to determine both the amplitude and direction of synaptic plasticity by differential activation of Ca2+ -sensitive enzymes such as calmodulin. Ca2+ influx is negatively regulated by Ca2+ -activated K+ channels (SK-channels) which are in turn inhibited by neuromodulators such as acetylcholine. However, the precise mechanisms by which SK-channels control the induction of synaptic plasticity remain unclear. Using a 3-dimensional model of Ca2+ and calmodulin dynamics within an idealised, but biophysically-plausible, dendritic spine, we show that SK-channels regulate calmodulin activation specifically during neuron-firing patterns associated with induction of spike timing-dependent plasticity. SK-channel activation and the subsequent reduction in Ca2+ influx through NMDARs and L-type VGCCs results in an order of magnitude decrease in calmodulin (CaM) activation, providing a mechanism for the effective gating of synaptic plasticity induction. This provides a common mechanism for the regulation of synaptic plasticity by neuromodulators.},

We show that, in addition to reproducing experimental data for paired spikes, the model can explain differences in experimentally observed STDP forms.

	abstract = {Theoretical and computational frameworks for synaptic plasticity and learning have a long and cherished history, with few parallels within the well-established literature for plasticity of voltage-gated ion channels. In this study, we derive rules for plasticity in the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, and assess the synergy between synaptic and HCN channel plasticity in establishing stability during synaptic learning. To do this, we employ a conductance-based model for the hippocampal pyramidal neuron, and incorporate synaptic plasticity through the well-established Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM)-like rule for synaptic plasticity, wherein the direction and strength of the plasticity is dependent on the concentration of calcium influx. Under this framework, we derive a rule for HCN channel plasticity to establish homeostasis in synaptically-driven firing rate, and incorporate such plasticity into our model. In demonstrating that this rule for HCN channel plasticity helps maintain firing rate homeostasis after bidirectional synaptic plasticity, we observe a linear relationship between synaptic plasticity and HCN channel plasticity for maintaining firing rate homeostasis. Motivated by this linear relationship, we derive a calcium-dependent rule for HCN-channel plasticity, and demonstrate that firing rate homeostasis is maintained in the face of synaptic plasticity when moderate and high levels of cytosolic calcium influx induced depression and potentiation of the HCN-channel conductance, respectively. Additionally, we show that such synergy between synaptic and HCN-channel plasticity enhances the stability of synaptic learning through metaplasticity in the BCM-like synaptic plasticity profile. Finally, we demonstrate that the synergistic interaction between synaptic and HCN-channel plasticity preserves robustness of information transfer across the neuron under a rate-coding schema. Our results establish specific physiological roles for experimentally observed plasticity in HCN channels accompanying synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons, and uncover potential links between HCN-channel plasticity and calcium influx, dynamic gain control and stable synaptic learning. © 2013 Honnuraiah, Narayanan.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0102601},
	abstract = {Finding the rules underlying how axons of cortical neurons form neural circuits and modify their corresponding synaptic strength is the still subject of intense research. Experiments have shown that internal calcium concentration, and both the precise timing and temporal order of pre and postsynaptic action potentials, are important constituents governing whether the strength of a synapse located on the dendrite is increased or decreased. In particular, previous investigations focusing on spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) have typically observed an asymmetric temporal window governing changes in synaptic efficacy. Such a temporal window emphasizes that if a presynaptic spike, arriving at the synaptic terminal, precedes the generation of a postsynaptic action potential, then the synapse is potentiated; however if the temporal order is reversed, then depression occurs. Furthermore, recent experimental studies have now demonstrated that the temporal window also depends on the dendritic location of the synapse. Specifically, it was shown that in distal regions of the apical dendrite, the magnitude of potentiation was smaller and the window for depression was broader, when compared to observations from the proximal region of the dendrite. To date, the underlying mechanism(s) for such a distance-dependent effect is (are) currently unknown. Here, using the ionic cable theory framework in conjunction with the standard calcium based plasticity model, we show for the first time that such distance-dependent inhomogeneities in the temporal learning window for STDP can be largely explained by both the spatial and active properties of the dendrite. © 2014 Iannella et al.},

LTP occurs when a single presynaptic spike precedes a postsynaptic one (a positive interspike interval, or ISI), while the reverse order of activity (a negative ISI) produces LTD. A fundamental question is whether the "standard model" of plasticity in which moderate increases in Ca2+ influx through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) channels induce LTD and large increases induce LTP, can account for the order and interval sensitivity of STDP. To examine this issue we developed a model that captures postsynaptic Ca2+ influx dynamics and the associativity of the NMDA receptors. While this model can generate both LTD and LTP, it predicts that LTD will be observed at both negative and positive ISIs. This is because longer and longer positive ISIs induce monotonically decreasing levels of Ca2+, which eventually fall into the same range that produced LTD at negative ISIs. A second model that incorporated a second coincidence detector in addition to the NMDA receptor generated LTP at positive intervals and LTD only at negative ones. Our findings suggest that a single coincidence detector model based on the standard model of plasticity cannot account for order-specific STDP, and we predict that STDP requires two coincidence detectors.},

	abstract = {The NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity is thought to mediate several forms of learning, and can be induced by spike trains containing a small number of spikes occurring with varying rates and timing, as well as with oscillations. We computed the influence of these variables on the plasticity induced at a single NMDAR containing synapse using a reduced model that was analytically tractable, and these findings were confirmed using detailed, multi-compartment model. In addition to explaining diverse experimental results about the rate and timing dependence of synaptic plasticity, the model made several novel and testable predictions. We found that there was a preferred frequency for inducing long-term potentiation (LTP) such that higher frequency stimuli induced lesser LTP, decreasing as 1/f when the number of spikes in the stimulus was kept fixed. Among other things, the preferred frequency for inducing LTP varied as a function of the distance of the synapse from the soma. In fact, same stimulation frequencies could induce LTP or long-term depression depending on the dendritic location of the synapse. Next, we found that rhythmic stimuli induced greater plasticity then irregular stimuli. Furthermore, brief bursts of spikes significantly expanded the timing dependence of plasticity. Finally, we found that in the ∼5-15-Hz frequency range both rateand timing-dependent plasticity mechanisms work synergistically to render the synaptic plasticity most sensitive to spike timing. These findings provide computational evidence that oscillations can have a profound influence on the plasticity of an NMDAR-dependent synapse, and show a novel role for the dendritic morphology in this process.},

Here, we derive a mathematical framework enabling the simplification of such detailed models of synaptic plasticity facilitating further mathematical analyses. By this framework we obtain a compact, firing-rate-dependent mathematical formulation, which includes the essential dynamics of the detailed model and, thus, of experimentally verified properties of synaptic plasticity. Amongst others, by testing our framework by abstracting the dynamics of two well-established calcium-dependent synaptic plasticity models, we derived that the synaptic changes depend on the square of the presynaptic firing rate, which is in contrast to previous assumptions. Thus, the here-presented framework enables the derivation of biologically plausible but simple mathematical models of synaptic plasticity allowing to analyze the underlying dependencies of synaptic dynamics from neuronal properties such as the firing rate and to investigate their implications in complex neuronal networks.},

In order to maintain plasticity-induced changes for longer time scales (up to several days), they have to be consolidated by transferring them from a short-lasting early-phase to a long-lasting late-phase state. The underlying processes of this synaptic consolidation are already well-known for homosynaptic plasticity, however, it is not clear whether the same processes also enable the induction and consolidation of heterosynaptic plasticity. In this study, by extending a generic calcium-based plasticity model with the processes of synaptic consolidation, we show in simulations that indeed heterosynaptic plasticity can be induced and, furthermore, consolidated by the same underlying processes as for homosynaptic plasticity. Furthermore, we show that by local diffusion processes the heterosynaptic effect can be restricted to a few synapses neighboring the homosynaptically changed ones. Taken together, this generic model reproduces many experimental results of synaptic tagging and consolidation, provides several predictions for heterosynaptic induction and consolidation, and yields insights into the complex interactions between homo- and heterosynaptic plasticity over a broad variety of time (minutes to days) and spatial scales (several micrometers).},

	abstract = {Key points: Calcium (Ca2+) entry mediated by NMDA receptors is considered central to the induction of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in hippocampal area CA1; this description does not, however, take into account the potential contribution of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores. The ER has a heterogeneous distribution in CA1 dendritic spines, and may introduce localized functional differences in Ca2+ signalling between synapses, as suggested by experiments on metabotropic receptor-dependent long-term depression. A physiologically detailed computational model of Ca2+ dynamics at a CA3–CA1 excitatory synapse characterizes the contribution of spine ER via metabotropic signalling during plasticity induction protocols. ER Ca2+ release via IP3 receptors modulates NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity in a graded manner, to selectively promote synaptic depression with relatively diminished effect on LTP induction; this may temper further strengthening at the stronger synapses which are preferentially associated with ER-containing spines. Acquisition of spine ER may thus represent a local, biophysically plausible ‘metaplastic switch’ at potentiated CA1 synapses, contributing to the plasticity–stability balance in neural circuits. Abstract: Long-term plasticity mediated by NMDA receptors supports input-specific, Hebbian forms of learning at excitatory CA3–CA1 connections in the hippocampus. There exists an additional layer of stabilizing mechanisms that act globally as well as locally over multiple time scales to ensure that plasticity occurs in a constrained manner. Here, we investigated the role of calcium (Ca2+) stores associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the local regulation of plasticity at individual CA1 synapses. Our study was spurred by (1) the curious observation that ER is sparsely distributed in dendritic spines, but over-represented in larger spines that are likely to have undergone activity-dependent strengthening, and (2) evidence suggesting that ER motility at synapses can be rapid, and accompany activity-regulated spine remodelling. We constructed a physiologically realistic computational model of an ER-bearing CA1 spine, and examined how IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores affect spine Ca2+ dynamics during activity patterns mimicking the induction of long-term potentiation and long-term depression (LTD). Our results suggest that the presence of ER modulates NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity in a graded manner that selectively enhances LTD induction. We propose that ER may locally tune Ca2+-based plasticity, providing a braking mechanism to mitigate runaway strengthening at potentiated synapses. Our study provides a biophysically accurate description of postsynaptic Ca2+ regulation, and suggests that ER in the spine may promote the re-use of hippocampal synapses with saturated strengths.},

	abstract = {Corticostriatal synapse plasticity of medium spiny neurons is regulated by glutamate input from the cortex and dopamine input from the substantia nigra. While cortical stimulation alone results in long-term depression (LTD), the combination with dopamine switches LTD to long-term potentiation (LTP), which is known as dopamine-dependent plasticity. LTP is also induced by cortical stimulation in magnesium-free solution, which leads to massive calcium influx through NMDA-type receptors and is regarded as calcium-dependent plasticity. Signaling cascades in the corticostriatal spines are currently under investigation. However, because of the existence of multiple excitatory and inhibitory pathways with loops, the mechanisms regulating the two types of plasticity remain poorly understood. A signaling pathway model of spines that express D1-type dopamine receptors was constructed to analyze the dynamic mechanisms of dopamine- and calciumdependent plasticity. The model incorporated all major signaling molecules, including dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein with a molecular weight of 32 kDa (DARPP32), as well as AMPA receptor trafficking in the post-synaptic membrane. Simulations with dopamine and calcium inputs reproduced dopamine- and calcium-dependent plasticity. Further in silico experiments revealed that the positive feedback loop consisted of protein kinase A (PKA), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the phosphorylation site at threonine 75 of DARPP-32 (Thr75) served as the major switch for inducing LTD and LTP. Calcium input modulated this loop through the PP2B (phosphatase 2B)-CK1 (casein kinase 1)-Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5)-Thr75 pathway and PP2A, whereas calcium and dopamine input activated the loop via PKA activation by cyclic AMP (cAMP). The positive feedback loop displayed robust bi-stable responses following changes in the reaction parameters. Increased basal dopamine levels disrupted this dopamine-dependent plasticity. The present model elucidated the mechanisms involved in bidirectional regulation of corticostriatal synapses and will allow for further exploration into causes and therapies for dysfunctions such as drug addiction. © 2010 Nakano et al.},

	abstract = {Calcium has been proposed as a postsynaptic signal underlying synaptic spike-timing - dependent plasticity (STDP). We examine this hypothesis with computational modeling based on experimental results from hippocampal cultures, some of which are presented here, in which pairs and triplets of pre- and postsynaptic spikes induce potentiation and depression in a temporally asymmetric way. Specifically, we present a set of model biochemical detectors, based on plausible molecular pathways, which make direct use of the time course of the calcium signal to reproduce these experimental STDP results. Our model features a modular structure, in which long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) components compete to determine final plasticity outcomes; one aspect of this competition is a veto through which appropriate calcium time courses suppress LTD. Simulations of our model are also shown to be consistent with classical LTP and LTD induced by several presynaptic stimulation paradigms. Overall, our results provide computational evidence that, while the postsynaptic calcium time course contains sufficient information to distinguish various experimental long-term plasticity paradigms, small changes in the properties of back-propagation of action potentials or in synaptic dynamics can alter the calcium time course in ways that will significantly affect STDP induction by any detector based exclusively on postsynaptic calcium. This may account for the variability of STDP outcomes seen within hippocampal cultures, under repeated application of a single experimental protocol, as well as for that seen in multiple spike experiments across different systems.},

	abstract = {How do neurons reconcile the maintenance of calcium homeostasis with perpetual switches in patterns of afferent activity? Here, we assessed state-dependent evolution of calcium homeostasis in a population of hippocampal pyramidal neuron models, through an adaptation of a recent study on stomatogastric ganglion neurons. Calcium homeostasis was set to emerge through cell-autonomous updates to 12 ionic conductances, responding to different types of synaptically driven afferent activity. We first assessed the impact of theta-frequency inputs on the evolution of ionic conductances toward maintenance of calcium homeostasis. Although calcium homeostasis emerged efficaciously across all models in the population, disparate changes in ionic conductances that mediated this emergence resulted in variable plasticity to several intrinsic properties, also manifesting as significant differences in firing responses across models. Assessing the sensitivity of this form of plasticity, we noted that intrinsic neuronal properties and the firing response were sensitive to the target calcium concentration and to the strength and frequency of afferent activity. Next, we studied the evolution of calcium homeostasis when afferent activity was switched, in different temporal sequences, between two behaviorally distinct types of activity: theta-frequency inputs and sharp-wave ripples riding on largely silent periods. We found that the conductance values, intrinsic properties, and firing response of neurons exhibited differential robustness to an intervening switch in the type of afferent activity. These results unveil critical dissociations between different forms of homeostasis, and call for a systematic evaluation of the impact of state-dependent switches in afferent activity on neuronal intrinsic properties during neural coding and homeostasis.},

	abstract = {It is widely accepted that the direction and magnitude of synaptic plasticity depends on post-synaptic calcium flux, where high levels of calcium lead to long-term potentiation and moderate levels lead to long-term depression. At synapses onto neurons in region CA1 of the hippocampus (and many other synapses), NMDA receptors provide the relevant source of calcium. In this regard, post-synaptic calcium captures the coincidence of pre- and post-synaptic activity, due to the blockage of these receptors at low voltage. Previous studies show that under spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) protocols, potentiation at CA1 synapses requires post-synaptic bursting and an inter-pairing frequency in the range of the hippocampal theta rhythm. We hypothesize that these requirements reflect the saturation of the mechanisms of calcium extrusion from the post-synaptic spine. We test this hypothesis with a minimal model of NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity, simulating slow extrusion with a calcium-dependent calcium time constant. In simulations of STDP experiments, the model accounts for latency-dependent depression with either post-synaptic bursting or theta-frequency pairing (or neither) and accounts for latency-dependent potentiation when both of these requirements are met. The model makes testable predictions for STDP experiments and our simple implementation is tractable at the network level, demonstrating associative learning in a biophysical network model with realistic synaptic dynamics. © 2014 Standage et al.},

	abstract = {Endogenous extracellular adenosine level fluctuates in an activity-dependent manner and with sleep–wake cycle, modulating synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity. Hebbian-type long-term plasticity introduces intrinsic positive feedback on synaptic weight changes, making them prone to runaway dynamics. We previously demonstrated that co-occurring, weight-dependent heterosynaptic plasticity can robustly prevent runaway dynamics. Here we show that at neocortical synapses in slices from rat visual cortex, adenosine modulates the weight dependence of heterosynaptic plasticity: blockade of adenosine A1 receptors abolished weight dependence, while increased adenosine level strengthened it. Using model simulations, we found that the strength of weight dependence determines the ability of heterosynaptic plasticity to prevent runaway dynamics of synaptic weights imposed by Hebbian-type learning. Changing the weight dependence of heterosynaptic plasticity within an experimentally observed range gradually shifted the operating point of neurons between an unbalancing regime dominated by associative plasticity and a homeostatic regime of tightly constrained synaptic changes. Because adenosine tone is a natural correlate of activity level (activity increases adenosine tone) and brain state (elevated adenosine tone increases sleep pressure), modulation of heterosynaptic plasticity by adenosine represents an endogenous mechanism that translates changes of the brain state into a shift of the regime of synaptic plasticity and learning. We speculate that adenosine modulation may provide a mechanism for fine-tuning of plasticity and learning according to brain state and activity.},

Here we consider two broad kinds of plasticity that differ in their requirement for presynaptic activity during the induction. Homosynaptic plasticity occurs at synapses that were active during the induction. It is also called input specific or associative, and it is governed by Hebbian-type learning rules. Heterosynaptic plasticity can be induced by episodes of strong postsynaptic activity also at synapses that were not active during the induction, thus making any synapse at a cell a target to heterosynaptic changes. Both forms can be induced by typical protocols used for plasticity induction and operate on the same time scales but have differential computational properties and play different roles in learning systems. Homosynaptic plasticity mediates associative modifications of synaptic weights. Heterosynaptic plasticity counteracts runaway dynamics introduced by Hebbian-type rules and balances synaptic changes. It provides learning systems with stability and enhances synaptic competition. We conclude that homosynaptic and heterosynaptic plasticity represent complementary properties of modifiable synapses, and both are necessary for normal operation of neural systems with plastic synapses.},

	abstract = {Homosynaptic Hebbian-type plasticity provides a cellular mechanism of learning and refinement of connectivity during development in a variety of biological systems. In this review we argue that a complimentary form of plasticity—heterosynaptic plasticity—represents a necessary cellular component for homeostatic regulation of synaptic weights and neuronal activity. The required properties of a homeostatic mechanism which acutely constrains the runaway dynamics imposed by Hebbian associative plasticity have been well-articulated by theoretical and modeling studies. Such mechanism(s) should robustly support the stability of operation of neuronal networks and synaptic competition, include changes at non-active synapses, and operate on a similar time scale to Hebbian-type plasticity. The experimentally observed properties of heterosynaptic plasticity have introduced it as a strong candidate to fulfill this homeostatic role. Subsequent modeling studies which incorporate heterosynaptic plasticity into model neurons with Hebbian synapses (utilizing an STDP learning rule) have confirmed its ability to robustly provide stability and competition. In contrast, properties of homeostatic synaptic scaling, which is triggered by extreme and long lasting (hours and days) changes of neuronal activity, do not fit two crucial requirements for a hypothetical homeostatic mechanism needed to provide stability of operation in the face of on-going synaptic changes driven by Hebbian-type learning rules. Both the trigger and the time scale of homeostatic synaptic scaling are fundamentally different from those of the Hebbian-type plasticity. We conclude that heterosynaptic plasticity, which is triggered by the same episodes of strong postsynaptic activity and operates on the same time scale as Hebbian-type associative plasticity, is ideally suited to serve a homeostatic role during on-going synaptic plasticity.},

Such a balance is arguably preserved in dendritic branches, yet its underlying mechanism and functional roles remain unknown. In this study, we developed computational models of heterosynaptic spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) to show that the excitatory/inhibitory balance in dendritic branches is robustly achieved through heterosynaptic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The model reproduces key features of experimental heterosynaptic STDP well, and provides analytical insights. Furthermore, heterosynaptic STDP explains how the maturation of inhibitory neurons modulates the selectivity of excitatory neurons for binocular matching in the critical period plasticity. The model also provides an alternative explanation for the potential mechanism underlying the somatic detailed balance that is commonly associated with inhibitory STDP. Our results propose heterosynaptic STDP as a critical factor in synaptic organization and the resultant dendritic computation.},

	doi = {10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0552-16.2016},
	abstract = {Hebbian-type learning rules, which underlie learning and refinement of neuronal connectivity, postulate input specificity of synaptic changes. However, theoretical analyses have long appreciated that additional mechanisms, not restricted to activated synapses, are needed to counteract positive feedback imposed by Hebbian-type rules on synaptic weight changes and to achieve stable operation of learning systems. The biological basis of such mechanisms has remained elusive. Here we show that, in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons from slices of visual cortex of rats, synaptic changes induced at individual synapses by spike timing-dependent plasticity do not strictly follow the input specificity rule. Spike timing-dependent plasticity is accompanied by changes in unpaired synapses: heterosynaptic plasticity. The direction of heterosynaptic changes is weight-dependent, with balanced potentiation and depression, so that the total synaptic input to a cell remains preserved despite potentiation or depression of individual synapses. Importantly, this form of heterosynaptic plasticity is induced at unpaired synapses by the same pattern of postsynaptic activity that induces homosynaptic changes at paired synapses. In computer simulations, we show that experimentally observed heterosynaptic plasticity can indeed serve the theoretically predicted role of robustly preventing runaway dynamics of synaptic weights and activity. Moreover, it endows model neurons and networks with essential computational features: enhancement of synaptic competition, facilitation of the development of specific intrinsic connectivity, and the ability for relearning. We conclude that heterosynaptic plasticity is an inherent property of plastic synapses, crucial for normal operation of learning systems.},

Even days after formation, and despite ongoing network activity and synaptic plasticity, memories could be recalled through selective delay activity following the brief stimulation of a subset of assembly neurons.

	abstract = {"Use it or lose it" is a popular adage often associated with use-dependent enhancement of cognitive abilities. Much research has focused on understanding exactly how the brain changes as a function of experience. Such experience-dependent plasticity involves both structural and functional alterations that contribute to adaptive behaviors, such as learning and memory, as well as maladaptive behaviors, including anxiety disorders, phobias, and posttraumatic stress disorder. With the advancing age of our population, understanding how use-dependent plasticity changes across the lifespan may also help to promote healthy brain aging. A common misconception is that such experience-dependent plasticity (e.g., associative learning) is synonymous with synaptic plasticity. Other forms of plasticity also play a critical role in shaping adaptive changes within the nervous system, including intrinsic plasticity - a change in the intrinsic excitability of a neuron. Intrinsic plasticity can result from a change in the number, distribution or activity of various ion channels located throughout the neuron. Here, we review evidence that intrinsic plasticity is an important and evolutionarily conserved neural correlate of learning. Intrinsic plasticity acts as a metaplasticity mechanism by lowering the threshold for synaptic changes. Thus, learning-related intrinsic changes can facilitate future synaptic plasticity and learning. Such intrinsic changes can impact the allocation of a memory trace within a brain structure, and when compromised, can contribute to cognitive decline during the aging process. This unique role of intrinsic excitability can provide insight into how memories are formed and, more interestingly, how neurons that participate in a memory trace are selected. Most importantly, modulation of intrinsic excitability can allow for regulation of learning ability - this can prevent or provide treatment for cognitive decline not only in patients with clinical disorders but also in the aging population.},

Many neuroscientists have focused on the activity- and experience-dependent modifications of synaptic functions in order to solve these fundamental questions in neuroscience. Recently, the plasticity of intrinsic excitability (called intrinsic plasticity) has emerged as an important element for information processing and storage in the brain. As the cerebellar Purkinje cells are the sole output neurons in the cerebellar cortex and the information is conveyed from a neuron to its relay neurons by forms of action potential firing, the modulation of the intrinsic firing activity may play a critical role in the cerebellar learning. Many voltage-gated and/or Ca2+-activated ion channels are involved in shaping the spiking output as well as integrating synaptic inputs to finely tune the cerebellar output. Recent studies suggested that the modulation of the intrinsic excitability and its plasticity in the cerebellar Purkinje cells might function as an integrator for information processing and memory formation. Moreover, the intrinsic plasticity might also determine the strength of connectivity to the sub-cortical areas such as deep cerebellar nuclei and vestibular nuclei to trigger the consolidation of the cerebellardependent memory by transferring the information.},

	abstract = {Part of hippocampal and cortical plasticity is characterized by synaptic modifications that depend on the joint activity of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons. To which extent those changes are determined by the exact timing and the average firing rates is still a matter of debate; this may vary from brain area to brain area, as well as across neuron types. However, it has been robustly observed both in vitro and in vivo that plasticity itself slowly adapts as a function of the dynamical context a phenomena commonly referred to as metaplasticity. An alternative concept considers the regulation of groups of synapses with an objective at the neuronal level, for example, maintaining a given average firing rate. In that case, the change in the strength of a particular synapse of the group (e.g., due to Hebbian learning) affects others' strengths, which has been coined as heterosynaptic plasticity. Classically, Hebbian synaptic plasticity is paired in neuron network models with such mechanisms in order to stabilize the activity and/or the weight structure. Here, we present an oriented review that brings together various concepts from heterosynaptic plasticity to metaplasticity, and show how they interact with Hebbian-type learning. We focus on approaches that are nowadays used to incorporate those mechanisms to state-of-the-art models of spiking plasticity inspired by experimental observations in the hippocampus and cortex. Making the point that metaplasticity is an ubiquitous mechanism acting on top of classical Hebbian learning and promoting the stability of neural function over multiple timescales, we stress the need for incorporating it as a key element in the framework of plasticity models. Bridging theoretical and experimental results suggests a more functional role for metaplasticity mechanisms than simply stabilizing neural activity.},

We present a mathematical model that describes these different phases of synaptic plasticity. The model explains a large body of experimental data on synaptic tagging and capture, cross-tagging, and the late phases of LTP and LTD. Moreover, the model accounts for the dependence of LTP and LTD induction on voltage and presynaptic stimulation frequency. The stabilization of potentiated synapses during the transition from early to late LTP occurs by protein synthesis dynamics that are shared by groups of synapses. The functional consequence of this shared process is that previously stabilized patterns of strong or weak synapses onto the same postsynaptic neuron are well protected against later changes induced by LTP/LTD protocols at individual synapses. © 2008 Clopath et al.},

	abstract = {In spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) change in synaptic strength depends on the timing of pre-vs. postsynaptic spiking activity. Since STDP is in compliance with Hebb’s postulate, it is considered one of the major mechanisms of memory storage and recall. STDP comprises a system of two coincidence detectors with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation often posited as one of the main components. Numerous studies have unveiled a third component of this coincidence detection system, namely neuromodulation and glia activity shaping STDP. Even though dopaminergic control of STDP has most often been reported, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, nitric oxide (NO), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) also has been shown to effectively modulate STDP. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that astrocytes, via the release or uptake of glutamate, gate STDP expression. At the most fundamental level, the timing properties of STDP are expected to depend on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the underlying signaling pathways. However in most cases, due to technical limitations experiments grant only indirect access to these pathways. Computational models carefully constrained by experiments, allow for a better qualitative understanding of the molecular basis of STDP and its regulation by neuromodulators. Recently, computational models of calcium dynamics and signaling pathway molecules have started to explore STDP emergence in ex and in vivo-like conditions. These models are expected to reproduce better at least part of the complex modulation of STDP as an emergent property of the underlying molecular pathways. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying STDP modulation and its consequences on network dynamics is of critical importance and will allow better understanding of the major mechanisms of memory storage and recall both in health and disease.},

Modern theories of synaptic plasticity have postulated that the co-activation of pre- and postsynaptic neurons sets a flag at the synapse, called an eligibility trace, that leads to a weight change only if an additional factor is present while the flag is set. This third factor, signaling reward, punishment, surprise, or novelty, could be implemented by the phasic activity of neuromodulators or specific neuronal inputs signaling special events.

	abstract = {In Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning, reward typically comes seconds after reward-triggering actions, creating an explanatory conundrum known as "distal reward problem": How does the brain know what firing patterns of what neurons are responsible for the reward if 1) the patterns are no longer there when the reward arrives and 2) all neurons and synapses are active during the waiting period to the reward? Here, we show how the conundrum is resolved by a model network of cortical spiking neurons with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) modulated by dopamine (DA). Although STDP is triggered by nearly coincident firing patterns on a millisecond timescale, slow kinetics of subsequent synaptic plasticity is sensitive to changes in the extracellular DA concentration during the critical period of a few seconds. Random firings during the waiting period to the reward do not affect STDP and hence make the network insensitive to the ongoing activity - the key feature that distinguishes our approach from previous theoretical studies, which implicitly assume that the network be quiet during the waiting period or that the patterns be preserved until the reward arrives. This study emphasizes the importance of precise firing patterns in brain dynamics and suggests how a global diffusive reinforcement signal in the form of extracellular DA can selectively influence the right synapses at the right time. © The Author 2007.

	abstract = {Reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) has recently emerged as a candidate for a learning rule that could explain how behaviorally relevant adaptive changes in complex networks of spiking neurons could be achieved in a self-organizing manner through local synaptic plasticity. However, the capabilities and limitations of this learning rule could so far only be tested through computer simulations. This article provides tools for an analytic treatment of reward-modulated STDP, which allows us to predict under which conditions reward-modulated STDP will achieve a desired learning effect. These analytical results imply that neurons can learn through reward-modulated STDP to classify not only spatial but also temporal firing patterns of presynaptic neurons. They also can learn to respond to specific presynaptic firing patterns with particular spike patterns. Finally, the resulting learning theory predicts that even difficult credit-assignment problems, where it is very hard to tell which synaptic weights should be modified in order to increase the global reward for the system, can be solved in a self-organizing manner through reward-modulated STDP. This yields an explanation for a fundamental experimental result on biofeedback in monkeys by Fetz and Baker. In this experiment monkeys were rewarded for increasing the firing rate of a particular neuron in the cortex and were able to solve this extremely difficult credit assignment problem. Our model for this experiment relies on a combination of reward-modulated STDP with variable spontaneous firing activity. Hence it also provides a possible functional explanation for trial-to-trial variability, which is characteristic for cortical networks of neurons but has no analogue in currently existing artificial computing systems. In addition our model demonstrates that reward-modulated STDP can be applied to all synapses in a large recurrent neural network without endangering the stability of the network dynamics. © 2008 Legenstein et al.},

	doi = {10.3389/fnsyn.2016.00038},
	abstract = {Neuromodulators play a ubiquitous role across the brain in regulating plasticity. With recent advances in experimental techniques, it is possible to study the effects of diverse neuromodulatory states in specific brain regions. Neuromodulators are thought to impact plasticity predominantly through two mechanisms: the gating of plasticity and the upregulation of neuronal activity. However, the consequences of these mechanisms are poorly understood and there is a need for both experimental and theoretical exploration. Here we illustrate how neuromodulatory state affects cortical plasticity through these two mechanisms. First, we explore the ability of neuromodulators to gate plasticity by reshaping the learning window for spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Using a simple computational model, we implement four different learning rules and demonstrate their effects on receptive field plasticity. We then compare the neuromodulatory effects of upregulating learning rate versus the effects of upregulating neuronal activity. We find that these seemingly similar mechanisms do not yield the same outcome: upregulating neuronal activity can lead to either a broadening or a sharpening of receptive field tuning, whereas upregulating learning rate only intensifies the sharpening of receptive field tuning. This simple model demonstrates the need for further exploration of the rich landscape of neuromodulator-mediated plasticity. Future experiments, coupled with biologically detailed computational models, will elucidate the diversity of mechanisms by which neuromodulatory state regulates cortical plasticity.},

	abstract = {Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is a widespread plasticity mechanism in the nervous system. The simplest description of STDP only takes into account pairs of pre- and postsynaptic spikes, with potentiation of the synapse when a presynaptic spike precedes a postsynaptic spike and depression otherwise. In light of experiments that explored a variety of spike patterns, the pair-based STDP model has been augmented to account for multiple pre- and postsynaptic spike interactions. As a result, a number of different “multi-spike” STDP models have been proposed based on different experimental observations. The behavior of these models at the population level is crucial for understanding mechanisms of learning and memory. The challenging balance between the stability of a population of synapses and their competitive modification is well studied for pair-based models, but it has not yet been fully analyzed for multi-spike models. Here, we address this issue through numerical simulations of an integrate-and-fire model neuron with excitatory synapses subject to STDP described by three different proposed multi-spike models. We also analytically calculate average synaptic changes and fluctuations about these averages. Our results indicate that the different multi-spike models behave quite differently at the population level. Although each model can produce synaptic competition in certain parameter regions, none of them induces synaptic competition with its originally fitted parameters. The dichotomy between synaptic stability and Hebbian competition, which is well characterized for pair-based STDP models, persists in multi-spike models. However, anti-Hebbian competition can coexist with synaptic stability in some models. We propose that the collective behavior of synaptic plasticity models at the population level should be used as an additional guideline in applying phenomenological models based on observations of single synapses.},

Our model describes several nonlinear effects that are observed in STDP experiments, as well as the voltage dependence of plasticity. We found that, in a simulated recurrent network of spiking neurons, our plasticity rule led not only to development of localized receptive fields but also to connectivity patterns that reflect the neural code. For temporal coding procedures with spatio-temporal input correlations, strong connections were predominantly unidirectional, whereas they were bidirectional under rate-coded input with spatial correlations only. Thus, variable connectivity patterns in the brain could reflect different coding principles across brain areas; moreover, our simulations suggested that plasticity is fast. © 2010 Nature America, Inc.

	abstract = {Long-term synaptic modification depends on the relative timing of individual pre- and postsynaptic spikes, but the rules governing the effects of multispike bursts remain to be fully understood. In particular, some studies suggest that the spike timing dependence of synaptic modification breaks down with high-frequency bursts. In this study, we characterized the effects of pre- and postsynaptic bursts on long-term modification of layer 2/3 synapses in visual cortical slices from young rats. We found that, while pairing-induced synaptic modification depends on the burst frequency, this dependence can be explained in terms of the timing of individual pre- and postsynaptic spikes. Later spikes in each burst are less effective in synaptic modification, but spike efficacy is regulated differently in pre- and postsynaptic bursts. Presynaptically, spike efficacy is progressively weakened, in parallel with short-term synaptic depression. Postsynaptically, spike efficacy is suppressed to a lesser extent, and it depends on postsynaptic potassium channel activation. Such timing-dependent interaction among multiple spikes can account for synaptic modifications induced by a variety of spike trains, including the frequency-dependent transition from depression to potentiation induced by a postsynaptic burst preceding a presynaptic burst.

	abstract = {According to spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), the timing of the Na + spike relative to the EPSP determines whether LTP or LTD will occur. Here, we review our reservations about STDP. Most investigations of this process have been done under conditions in which the spike is evoked by postsynaptic current injection. Under more realistic conditions, in which the spike is evoked by the EPSP, the results do not generally support STDP. For instance, low-frequency stimulation of a group of synapses can cause LTD, not the LTP predicted by the pre-before-post sequence in STDP; this is true regardless of whether or not the EPSP is large enough to produce a Na + spike. With stronger or more frequent stimulation, LTP can be induced by the same pre-before-post timing, but in this case block of Na + spikes does not necessarily prevent LTP induction. Thus, Na + spikes may facilitate LTP and/or LTD under some conditions, but they are not necessary, a finding consistent with their small size relative to the EPSP in many parts of pyramidal cell dendrites. The nature of the dendritic depolarizing events that control bidirectional plasticity is of central importance to understanding neural function. There are several candidates, including backpropagating action potentials, but also dendritic Ca 2+ spikes, the AMPA receptor-mediated EPSP, and NMDA receptor-mediated EPSPs or spikes. These often appear to be more important than the Na + spike in providing the depolarization necessary for plasticity. We thus feel that it is premature to accept STDP-like processes as the major determinant of LTP/LTD. © 2010 Lisman and Spruston.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the generation of multi-clustered structure of self-organized neural network with different neuronal firing patterns, i.e., bursting or spiking, has been investigated. The initially all-to-all-connected spiking neural network or bursting neural network can be self-organized into clustered structure through the symmetric spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning for both bursting and spiking neurons. However, the time consumption of this clustering procedure of the burst-based self-organized neural network (BSON) is much shorter than the spike-based self-organized neural network (SSON). Our results show that the BSON network has more obvious small-world properties, i.e., higher clustering coefficient and smaller shortest path length than the SSON network. Also, the results of larger structure entropy and activity entropy of the BSON network demonstrate that this network has higher topological complexity and dynamical diversity, which benefits for enhancing information transmission of neural circuits. Hence, we conclude that the burst firing can significantly enhance the efficiency of clustering procedure and the emergent clustered structure renders the whole network more synchronous and therefore more sensitive to weak input. This result is further confirmed from its improved performance on stochastic resonance. Therefore, we believe that the multi-clustered neural network which self-organized from the bursting dynamics has high efficiency in information processing.},

However, it remains unclear how oculomotor adaptation depends on the interplay between the characteristic Purkinje cell response patterns, namely tonic, bursting, and spike pauses. Here, a spiking cerebellar model assesses the role of Purkinje cell firing patterns in vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) adaptation. The model captures the cerebellar microcircuit properties and it incorporates spike-based synaptic plasticity at multiple cerebellar sites. A detailed Purkinje cell model reproduces the three spike-firing patterns that are shown to regulate the cerebellar output. Our results suggest that pauses following Purkinje complex spikes (bursts) encode transient disinhibition of target medial vestibular nuclei, critically gating the vestibular signals conveyed by mossy fibres. This gating mechanism accounts for early and coarse VOR acquisition, prior to the late reflex consolidation. In addition, properly timed and sized Purkinje cell bursts allow the ratio between long-term depression and potentiation (LTD/LTP) to be finely shaped at mossy fibre-medial vestibular nuclei synapses, which optimises VOR consolidation. Tonic Purkinje cell firing maintains the consolidated VOR through time. Importantly, pauses are crucial to facilitate VOR phase-reversal learning, by reshaping previously learnt synaptic weight distributions. Altogether, these results predict that Purkinje spike burst-pause dynamics are instrumental to VOR learning and reversal adaptation.},

In modeling studies, we find that this form of synaptic modification can automatically balance synaptic strengths to make postsynaptic firing irregular but more sensitive to presynaptic spike timing. It has been argued that neurons in vivo operate in such a balanced regime. Synapses modifiable by STDP compete for control of the timing of postsynaptic action potentials.

This selforganization process simulates three development phases: an early experience-independent phase, a late experience-independent phase and a subsequent refinement phase during which experience acts to shape the map properties. The ocular dominance maps that emerge accommodate the two sets of monocular inputs that arise from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to layer 4 of V1. The orientation selectivity maps that emerge feature well-developed isoorientation domains and fractures. During the last two phases of development the orientation preferences at some locations appear to rotate continuously through +/- 180° along circular paths and referred to as pinwheel-like patterns but without any corresponding point discontinuities in the orientation gradient maps. The formation of these functional maps is driven by balanced excitatory and inhibitory currents that are established via synaptic plasticity based on spike timing for both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The stability and maintenance of the formed maps with continuous synaptic plasticity is enabled by homeostasis caused by inhibitory plasticity. However, a prolonged exposure to repeated stimuli does alter the formed maps over time due to plasticity. The results from this study suggest that continuous synaptic plasticity in both excitatory neurons and interneurons could play a critical role in the formation, stability, and maintenance of functional maps in the cortex. © 2013 Srinivasa and Jiang.},

	abstract = {This chapter reviews recent advances in the understanding of neurochemical transmission and efficient models to incorporate synaptic interactions in neuronal models. After a brief introduction on the different types of ion channels and their gating mechanisms, the first section focuses on the mechanisms of transmitter release by presynaptic terminals. A detailed model of the release process is presented, as well as a simplified representation of the properties of release. The second section reviews detailed models for the most prominent "fast" receptor types in the CNS (AMPA, NMDA, GABAA) as well as neuromodulators (with GABAB receptors as a prototype). The next section provides the reader with simplified representations of these currents that are fast to compute while capturing the most salient features of AMPA, NMDA, GABAA and GABAB receptor-mediated neurotransmission. For both detailed and simplified models, the kinetic models are compared to experimental data. The last section gives practical implementations of the simplified models, by illustrating the summation of synaptic events for the different types of receptors. An example is also presented for network simulations in which synaptic interactions are represented by kinetic models. Finally, the appendixes gives more formal details on the kinetic representation of gating mechanisms, the procedures used to fit the models to experimental data, and optimized algorithms to implement kinetic synapse models at low computational cost.},

	abstract = {Memory is often defined as the mental capacity of retaining information about facts, events, procedures and more generally about any type of previous experience. Memories are remembered as long as they influence our thoughts, feelings, and behavior at the present time. Memory is also one of the fundamental components of learning, our ability to acquire any type of knowledge or skills. In the brain it is not easy to identify the physical substrate of memory. Basically, any long-lasting alteration of a biochemical process can be considered a form of memory, although some of these alterations last only a few milliseconds, and most of them, if taken individually, cannot influence our behavior. However, if we want to understand memory, we need to keep in mind that memory is not a unitary phenomenon, and it certainly involves several distinct mechanisms that operate at different spatial and temporal levels. One of the goals of theoretical neuroscience is to try to understand how these processes are orchestrated to store memories rapidly and preserve them over a lifetime. Theorists have mostly focused on synaptic plasticity, as it is one of the most studied memory mechanisms in experimental neuroscience and it is known to be highly effective in training artificial neural networks to perform real world tasks. Some of the synaptic plasticity models are purely phenomenological, some others have been designed to solve computational problems. In this article I will review some of these models and I will try to identify computational principles that underlie memory storage and preservation.},

	abstract = {The elementary processing units in the brain are neurons (see Chapter 2) which are connected to each other via cable-like extensions, called axons and dendrites (see Chapter 3). The contact points between an axon terminal of a neuron A and the dendrite of another neuron B are called synapses. The most important synapses are chemical synapses, but there exist also electrical synapses which we will not consider further. When an action potential of neuron A arrives at the axon terminating at a chemical synapse, a chemical signal (neurotransmit-ter) is ejected into the synaptic cleft and taken up by receptors sitting on the membrane of the dendrite of the receiving neuron. Upon transmitter binding, an ion channel opens, ions flow into the cell and cause a change in the proper-ties of neuron B. This change can be measured as an Excitatory or Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP or IPSP) at the soma of the receiving neuron (see Chapter 3). The strength of an excitatory synaptic connection can be quantified by the amplitude of the EPSP. The most important insight for all the rest of chapter is that the strength of a synapse is not fixed, but can change.},

	abstract = {We review a body of theoretical and experimental research on Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity, starting from a puzzling observation: while homeostasis of synapses found in experiments is a slow compensatory process, most mathematical models of synaptic plasticity use rapid compensatory processes (RCPs). Even worse, with the slow homeostatic plasticity reported in experiments, simulations of existing plasticity models cannot maintain network stability unless further control mechanisms are implemented. To solve this paradox, we suggest that in addition to slow forms of homeostatic plasticity there are RCPs which stabilize synaptic plasticity on short timescales. These rapid processes may include heterosynaptic depression triggered by episodes of high postsynaptic firing rate. While slower forms of homeostatic plasticity are not sufficient to stabilize Hebbian plasticity, they are important for fine-tuning neural circuits. Taken together we suggest that learning and memory rely on an intricate interplay of diverse plasticity mechanisms on different timescales which jointly ensure stability and plasticity of neural circuits.},

Hebb’s seminal work foreshadowed some of the great neuroscientific discoveries of the following decades, including the discovery of long-term potentiation and other lasting forms of synaptic plasticity, and more recently the residence of memories in synaptically connected neuronal assemblies. Our understanding of the processes underlying learning and memory has been dominated by the view that synapses are the principal site of information storage in the brain. This view has received substantial support from research in several model systems, with the vast majority of studies on the topic corroborating a role for synapses in memory storage. Yet, despite the neuroscience community’s best efforts, we are still without conclusive proof that memories reside at synapses. Furthermore, an increasing number of non-synaptic mechanisms have emerged that are also capable of acting as memory substrates. In this review, we address the key findings from the synaptic plasticity literature that make these phenomena such attractive memory mechanisms. We then turn our attention to evidence that questions the reliance of memory exclusively on changes at the synapse and attempt to integrate these opposing views.},

	abstract = {Synaptic short-term plasticity (STP) regulates synaptic transmission in an activity-dependent manner and thereby has important roles in the signal processing in the brain. In some synapses, a presynaptic train of action potentials elicits post-synaptic potentials that gradually increase during the train (facilitation), but in other synapses, these potentials gradually decrease (depression). We studied STP in neurons in the visual thalamic relay, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). The dLGN contains two types of neurons: excitatory thalamocortical (TC) neurons, which transfer signals from retinal afferents to visual cortex, and local inhibitory interneurons, which form an inhibitory feedforward loop that regulates the thalamocortical signal transmission. The overall STP in the retino-thalamic relay is short-term depression, but the distinct kind and characteristics of the plasticity at the different types of synapses are unknown. We studied STP in the excitatory responses of interneurons to stimulation of retinal afferents, in the inhibitory responses of TC neurons to stimulation of afferents from interneurons, and in the disynaptic inhibitory responses of TC neurons to stimulation of retinal afferents. Moreover, we studied STP at the direct excitatory input to TC neurons from retinal afferents. The STP at all types of the synapses showed short-term depression. This depression can accentuate rapid changes in the stream of signals and thereby promote detectability of significant features in the sensory input. In vision, detection of edges and contours is essential for object perception, and the synaptic short-term depression in the early visual pathway provides important contributions to this detection process.},

	abstract = {In cultures of dissociated rat hippocampal neurons, persistent potentiation and depression of glutamatergic synapses were induced by correlated spiking of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The relative timing between the presynaptic and postsynaptic spiking determined the direction and the extent of synaptic changes. Repetitive postsynaptic spiking within a time window of 20 msec after presynaptic activation resulted in long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas postsynaptic spiking within a window of 20 msec before the repetitive presynaptic activation led to long-term depression (LTD). Significant LTP occurred only at synapses with relatively low initial strength, whereas the extent of LTD did not show obvious dependence on the initial synaptic strength. Both LTP and LTD depended on the activation of NMDA receptors and were absent in cases in which the postsynaptic neurons were GABAergic in nature. Blockade of L-type calcium channels with nimodipine abolished the induction of LTD and reduced the extent of LTP. These results underscore the importance of precise spike timing, synaptic strength, and postsynaptic cell type in the activity- induced modification of central synapses and suggest that Hebb's rule may need to incorporate a quantitative consideration of spike timing that reflects the narrow and asymmetric window for the induction of synaptic modification.},

However, these changes must be coordinated across other synapses within local circuits to preserve neural coding schemes and the organization of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, i.e., excitatory-inhibitory balance. Recent studies indicate that inhibitory synapses are also plastic and are controlled directly by a large number of neuromodulators, particularly during episodes of learning. Many modulators transiently alter excitatory-inhibitory balance by decreasing inhibition, and thus disinhibition has emerged as a major mechanism by which neuromodulation might enable long-term synaptic modifications naturally.

	abstract = {How learning and memory is achieved in the brain is a central question in neuroscience. Key to today's research into information storage in the brain is the concept of synaptic plasticity, a notion that has been heavily influenced by Hebb's (1949) postulate. Hebb conjectured that repeatedly and persistently co-active cells should increase connective strength among populations of interconnected neurons as a means of storing a memory trace, also known as an engram. Hebb certainly was not the first to make such a conjecture, as we show in this history. Nevertheless, literally thousands of studies into the classical frequency-dependent paradigm of cellular learning rules were directly inspired by the Hebbian postulate. But in more recent years, a novel concept in cellular learning has emerged, where temporal order instead of frequency is emphasized. This new learning paradigm - known as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) - has rapidly gained tremendous interest, perhaps because of its combination of elegant simplicity, biological plausibility, and computational power. But what are the roots of today's STDP concept? Here, we discuss several centuries of diverse thinking, beginning with philosophers such as Aristotle, Locke, and Ribot, traversing, e.g., Lugaro's plasticità and Rosenblatt's perceptron, and culminating with the discovery of STDP. We highlight interactions between theoretical and experimental fields, showing how discoveries sometimes occurred in parallel, seemingly without much knowledge of the other field, and sometimes via concrete back-and-forth communication. We point out where the future directions may lie, which includes interneuron STDP, the functional impact of STDP, its mechanisms and its neuromodulatory regulation, and the linking of STDP to the developmental formation and continuous plasticity of neuronal networks. © 2011 Markram, Gerstner and Sjöström.},

	abstract = {Subsynaptic structures such as bouton, active zone, postsynaptic density (PSD) and dendritic spine, are highly correlated in their dimensions and also correlate with synapse strength. Why this is so and how such correlations are maintained during synaptic plasticity remains poorly understood. We induced spine enlargement by two-photon glutamate uncaging and examined the relationship between spine, PSD, and bouton size by two-photon time-lapse imaging and electron microscopy. In enlarged spines the PSD-associated protein Homer1c increased rapidly, whereas the PSD protein PSD-95 increased with a delay and only in cases of persistent spine enlargement. In the case of nonpersistent spine enlargement, the PSD proteins remained unchanged or returned to their original level. The ultrastructure at persistently enlarged spines displayed matching dimensions of spine, PSD, and bouton, indicating their correlated enlargement. This supports a model in which balancing of synaptic structures is a hallmark for the stabilization of structural modifications during synaptic plasticity. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

With this massive amount of information, it is often difficult, especially for someone not directly involved in the field, not to be overwhelmed. The goal of this review is to peel away as many layers as possible, and probe the core properties of LTP. We would argue that the many dozens of proteins that have been implicated in the phenomenon are not essential, but rather modulate, often in indirect ways, the threshold and/or magnitude of LTP. What is required is NMDA receptor activation followed by CaMKII activation. The consequence of CaMKII activation is the rapid recruitment of AMPA receptors to the synapse. This recruitment is independent of AMPA receptor subunit type, but absolutely requires an adequate pool of surface receptors. An important unresolved issue is how exactly CaMKII activation leads to modifications in the PSD to allow rapid enrichment.

	abstract = {Slow waves of non-REM sleep are suggested to play a role in shaping synaptic connectivity to consolidate recently acquired memories and/or restore synaptic homeostasis. During sleep slow waves, both GABAergic neurons of the nucleus reticularis thalami (NRT) and thalamocortical (TC) neurons discharge high-frequency bursts of action potentials mediated by low-threshold calcium spikes due to T-type Ca2+ channel activation. Although such activity of the intrathalamic network characterized by high-frequency firing and calcium influx is highly suited to modify synaptic efficacy, very little is still known about its consequences on intrathalamic synapse strength. Combining in vitro electrophysiological recordings and calcium imaging, here we show that the inhibitory GABAergic synapses between NRT and TC neurons of the rat somatosensory nucleus develop a long-term depression (I-LTD) when challenged by a stimulation paradigm that mimics the thalamic network activity occurring during sleep slow waves. The mechanism underlying this plasticity presents unique features as it is both heterosynaptic and homosynaptic in nature and requires Ca2+ entry selectively through T-type Ca2+ channels and activation of the Ca2+-activated phosphatase, calcineurin. We propose that during slow-wave sleep the tight functional coupling between GABAA receptors, calcineurin, and T-type Ca2+ channels will elicit LTD of the activated GABAergic synapses when coupled with concomitant activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors postsynaptic to cortical afferences. This I-LTD may be a key element involved in the reshaping of the somatosensory information pathway during sleep.},

New evidence suggests that the effect of action potential timing on synaptic plasticity may be an important element in reconciling homeostasis with adaptability. In particular, spike-timing dependent plasticity can act as both an adaptive and a homeostatic mechanism, controlling overall firing rates and distributions of synaptic efficacies while making neurons selective for certain aspects of their inputs. It can also cause networks that initially represent the present state of a stimulus to predict its future state on the basis of experience, a theoretical result supported by experimental data in behaving rats.},

	abstract = {Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is a widespread plasticity mechanism in the nervous system. The simplest description of STDP only takes into account pairs of pre- and postsynaptic spikes, with potentiation of the synapse when a presynaptic spike precedes a postsynaptic spike and depression otherwise. In light of experiments that explored a variety of spike patterns, the pair-based STDP model has been augmented to account for multiple pre- and postsynaptic spike interactions. As a result, a number of different “multi-spike” STDP models have been proposed based on different experimental observations. The behavior of these models at the population level is crucial for understanding mechanisms of learning and memory. The challenging balance between the stability of a population of synapses and their competitive modification is well studied for pair-based models, but it has not yet been fully analyzed for multi-spike models. Here, we address this issue through numerical simulations of an integrate-and-fire model neuron with excitatory synapses subject to STDP described by three different proposed multi-spike models. We also analytically calculate average synaptic changes and fluctuations about these averages. Our results indicate that the different multi-spike models behave quite differently at the population level. Although each model can produce synaptic competition in certain parameter regions, none of them induces synaptic competition with its originally fitted parameters. The dichotomy between synaptic stability and Hebbian competition, which is well characterized for pair-based STDP models, persists in multi-spike models. However, anti-Hebbian competition can coexist with synaptic stability in some models. We propose that the collective behavior of synaptic plasticity models at the population level should be used as an additional guideline in applying phenomenological models based on observations of single synapses.},

We explored whether memory performance can be improved by allowing synapses to traverse a large number of states before reaching their bounds, or by changing the way these bounds are imposed. In the case of hard bounds, memory lifetimes grow proportional to the square of the number of synaptic states, but only if potentiation and depression are precisely balanced. Improved performance can be obtained without fine tuning by imposing soft bounds, but this improvement is only linear with respect to the number of synaptic states. We explored several other possibilities and conclude that improving memory performance requires a more radical modification of the standard model of memory storage. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

One form of experimentally observed long-term synaptic plasticity, which we call spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), depends on the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials. In modeling studies, we find that this form of synaptic modification can automatically balance synaptic strengths to make postsynaptic firing irregular but more sensitive to presynaptic spike timing. It has been argued that neurons in vivo operate in such a balanced regime. Synapses modifiable by STDP compete for control of the timing of postsynaptic action potentials. Inputs that fire the postsynaptic neuron with short latency or that act in correlated groups are able to compete most successfully and develop strong synapses, while synapses of longer-latency or less-effective inputs are weakened.},

We propose a model in which the strengths of inhibitory synapses in a central pattern-generating circuit are subject to activity-dependent plasticity. The strength of each synapse is modified as a function of the global activity of the postsynaptic neuron and by correlated activity of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. This allows the self-assembly, from random initial synaptic strengths, of two cells into reciprocal oscillation and three cells into a rhythmic triphasic motor pattern. This self-assembly illustrates that complex oscillatory circuits that depend on multiple inhibitory synaptic connections can be tuned via simple activity-dependent rules.},

	abstract = {Although sleep-dependent consolidation and its neurochemical underpinnings have been strongly researched, less is known about how consolidation during sleep affects subsequent learning. Since sleep enhances memory, it can be expected to pro-actively interfere with learning after sleep, in particular of similar materials. This pro-active interference should be enhanced by substances that benefit consolidation during sleep, such as d-cycloserine. We tested this hypothesis in two groups (Sleep, Wake) of young healthy participants receiving on one occasion d-cycloserine (175 mg) and on another occasion placebo, according to a double-blind balanced crossover design. Treatment was administered after participants had learned a set of word pairs (A–B list) and before nocturnal retention periods of sleep vs. wakefulness. After d-cycloserine blood plasma levels had dropped to negligible amounts, i.e., the next day in the evening, participants learned, in three sequential runs, new sets of word pairs. One list—to enhance interference—consisted of the same cue words as the original set paired with a new target word (A–C list) and the other of completely new cue words (D–E set). Unexpectedly, during post-retention learning the A–C interference list was generally better learned than the completely new D–E list, which suggests that consolidation of previously encoded similar material enhances memory integration rather than pro-active interference. Consistent with this view, new learning of word pairs was better after sleep than wakefulness. Similarly, d-cycloserine generally enhanced learning of new word pairs, compared to placebo. This effect being independent of sleep or wakefulness, leads us to speculate that d-cycloserine, in addition to enhancing sleep-dependent consolidation, might mediate a time-dependent process of active forgetting.},

	abstract = {Sleep enhances memories, especially if they are related to future ewards. Although dopamine has been shown to be a key determinant during reward learning, the role of dopaminergic neurotransmission for amplifying reward-related memories during sleep remains unclear. In this study, we scrutinize the idea that dopamine is needed for the preferential consolidation of rewarded information. We impaired dopaminergic neurotransmission, thereby aiming to wipe out preferential sleep-dependent consolidation of high- over low-rewarded memories during sleep. Following a double-blind, balanced, crossover design, 17 young healthy men received the dopamine d2-like receptor blocker sulpiride (800 mg) or placebo, after learning a motivated learning task. The task required participants to memorize 80 highly and 80 lowly rewarded pictures. Half of them were presented for a short (750 msec) and a long (1500 msec) duration, respectively, which permitted dissociation of the effects of reward on sleep-associated consolidation from those of mere encoding depth. Retrieval was tested after a retention interval of approximately 22 hr that included 8 hr of nocturnal sleep. As expected, at retrieval, highly rewarded memories were remembered better than lowly rewarded memories, under placebo. However, there was no evidence for an effect of reducing dopaminergic neurotransmission with sulpiride during sleep on this differential retention of rewarded information. This result indicates that dopaminergic activation likely is not required for the preferential consolidation of reward-associated memory. Rather, it appears that dopaminergic activation only tags such memories at encoding for intensified reprocessing during sleep.},

	abstract = {Recently, compelling evidence has accumulated that links sleep to learning and memory. Sleep has been identified as a state that optimizes the consolidation of newly acquired information in memory. Consolidation is an active process that is presumed to rely on the covert reactivation and reorganization of newly encoded representations. Hippocampus-dependent memories benefit primarily from slow-wave sleep (SWS), whereas memories not depending on the hippocampus show greater gains over periods containing high amounts of rapid eye movement sleep. One way sleep does this is by establishing different patterns of neurotransmitters and neurohormone secretion between sleep stages. Another central role for consolidating memories is played by the slow oscillation, that is, the oscillating field potential change dominating SWS. The emergence of slow oscillations in neocortical networks depends on the prior use of these networks for encoding of information. Via efferent pathways, they synchronize the occurrence of sharp wave ripples accompanying memory reactivations in the hippocampus with thalamocortical spindle activity. Thus, hippocampal memories are fed back into neocortical networks at a time when these networks are depolarized and, because of concurrent spindle activity, can most sensitively react to these inputs with plastic changes underlying the formation of long-term memory representations.

	doi = {10.1007/s00426-011-0335-6},
	abstract = {Over the past two decades, research has accumulated compelling evidence that sleep supports the formation of long-term memory. The standard two-stage memory model that has been originally elaborated for declarative memory assumes that new memories are transiently encoded into a temporary store (represented by the hippocampus in the declarative memory system) before they are gradually transferred into a long-term store (mainly represented by the neocortex), or are forgotten. Based on this model, we propose that sleep, as an offline mode of brain processing, serves the 'active system consolidation' of memory, i. e. the process in which newly encoded memory representations become redistributed to other neuron networks serving as long-term store. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS) rather than rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The concept of active system consolidation during sleep implicates that (a) memories are reactivated during sleep to be consolidated, (b) the consolidation process during sleep is selective inasmuch as it does not enhance every memory, and (c) memories, when transferred to the long-term store undergo qualitative changes. Experimental evidence for these three central implications is provided: It has been shown that reactivation of memories during SWS plays a causal role for consolidation, that sleep and specifically SWS consolidates preferentially memories with relevance for future plans, and that sleep produces qualitative changes in memory representations such that the extraction of explicit and conscious knowledge from implicitly learned materials is facilitated. © 2011 The Author(s).},

Reconsolidation theory assumes that reactivation during wakefulness transiently destabilizes memories, requiring them to reconsolidate in order to persist. Memory reactivation also occurs during slow-wave sleep (SWS) and is assumed to underlie the consolidating effect of sleep. Here, we tested whether the same principle of transient destabilization applies to memory reactivation during SWS. We reactivated memories in humans by presenting associated odor cues either during SWS or wakefulness. Reactivation was followed by an interference task to probe memory stability. As we expected, reactivation during waking destabilized memories. In contrast, reactivation during SWS immediately stabilized memories, thereby directly increasing their resistance to interference. Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that reactivation during SWS mainly activated hippocampal and posterior cortical regions, whereas reactivation during wakefulness primarily activated prefrontal cortical areas. Our results show that reactivation of memory serves distinct functions depending on the brain state of wakefulness or sleep. © 2011 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

Active systems consolidation maintains that memory traces that are initially stored in a transient store such as the hippocampus are gradually redistributed towards more permanent storage sites such as the cortex during sleep replay. The complementary synaptic homeostasis theory posits that weak memory traces are erased during sleep through a competitive down-selection mechanism, ensuring the brain’s capability to learn new information. We discuss evidence from neuropharmacological experiments in humans to show how major neurotransmitters and neuromodulators are implicated in these memory processes. As to the major excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate that plays a prominent role in inducing synaptic consolidation, we show that these processes, while strengthening cortical memory traces during sleep, are insufficient to explain the consolidation of hippocampus-dependent declarative memories. In the inhibitory GABAergic system, we will offer insights how drugs may alter the intricate interplay of sleep oscillations that have been identified to be crucial for strengthening memories during sleep. Regarding the dopaminergic reward system, we will show how it is engaged during sleep replay, but that dopaminergic neuromodulation likely plays a side role for enhancing relevant memories during sleep. Also, we briefly go into basic evidence on acetylcholine and cortisol whose low tone during slow wave sleep (SWS) is crucial in supporting hippocampal-to-neocortical memory transmission. Finally, we will outline how these insights can be used to improve treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders focusing mainly on anxiety disorders, depression, and addiction that are strongly related to memory processing.},

After 36 h (including a night allowing recovery sleep) retrieval was tested. Compared with wakefulness, post-learning sleep enhanced retention for the 160 word-pair condition (p {\textless} 0.01), importantly, this effect completely vanished for the 320 word-pair condition. This result indicates a limited capacity for sleep-dependent memory consolidation, which is consistent with an active system consolidation view on sleep's role for memory, if it is complemented by processes of active forgetting and/or gist abstraction. Whereas the absolute benefit from sleep should have increased with increasing amounts of successfully encoded items, if sleep only passively protected memory from interference. Moreover, the finding that retention performance was significantly diminished for the 320 word-pair condition compared to the 160 word-pair condition in the sleep group, makes it tempting to speculate that with increasing loads of information encoded during wakefulness, sleep might favor processes of forgetting over consolidation.},

We highlight three features of this process: (i) hippocampal replay that, by capturing episodic memory aspects, drives consolidation of both hippocampus-dependent and non-hippocampus-dependent memory; (ii) brain oscillations hallmarking slow-wave and rapid-eye movement sleep that provide mechanisms for regulating both information flow across distant brain networks and local synaptic plasticity; and (iii) qualitative transformations of memories during systems consolidation resulting in abstracted, gist-like representations.},

Once consolidated, remote memories can return to a labile state upon reactivation and need to become reconsolidated in order to persist. Here we asked whether sleep also benefits the reconsolidation of remote memories after their reactivation and how reconsolidation during sleep compares to sleep-dependent consolidation processes. In three groups, participants were trained on a visuo-spatial learning task in the presence of a contextual odor. Participants in the ‘reconsolidation’ group learned the task on day 1. On day 2, they were subjected to a reactivation procedure by presenting the odor cue and a mock recall test in the learning context before a 40-min sleep or wake period. Participants in the ‘remote consolidation’ group followed the same procedure but did not receive reactivation on day 2. Participants in the ‘recent consolidation’ group skipped the procedure on day 1 and learned the task immediately before the sleep or wake period. After the sleep or wake interval, memory stability was tested in all subjects. The results show that this short 40-min sleep period significantly facilitated the reconsolidation of reactivated memories, whereas the consolidation of non-reactivated remote memories was less affected and recently encoded memories did not benefit at all. These findings tentatively suggest that sleep has a beneficial effect on the reconsolidation of remote memories, acting at a faster rate than sleep-associated consolidation.},

Combining optogenetics with a closed-loop stimulation approach in mice, we show here that only thalamic spindles induced in-phase with cortical slow oscillation up-states, but not out-of-phase-induced spindles, improve consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory during sleep. Whereas optogenetically stimulated spindles were as efficient as spontaneous spindles in nesting hippocampal ripples within their excitable troughs, stimulation in-phase with the slow oscillation up-state increased spindle co-occurrence and frontal spindle-ripple co-occurrence, eventually resulting in increased triple coupling of slow oscillation-spindle-ripple events. In-phase optogenetic suppression of thalamic spindles impaired hippocampus-dependent memory. Our results suggest a causal role for thalamic sleep spindles in hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation, conveyed through triple coupling of slow oscillations, spindles, and ripples. Latchoumane et al. demonstrate a causal role of sleep spindles in memory formation. They show that optogenetic induction of thalamic spindles, when phase-locked to the slow oscillation up-state, enhances the triple coupling of slow oscillations-spindles-ripples together with hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation.},

Here we show that cueing during NREM sleep significantly improved memory for emotional pictures, while no cueing benefit was observed during REM sleep. On the oscillatory level, successful memory cueing during NREM sleep resulted in significant increases in theta and spindle oscillations with stronger responses for emotional than neutral memories. In contrast during REM sleep, solely cueing of neutral (but not emotional) memories was associated with increases in theta activity. Our results do not support a preferential role of REM sleep for emotional memories, but rather suggest that emotional arousal modulates memory replay and consolidation processes and their oscillatory correlates during NREM sleep.},

The slow oscillations occurring during NonREM sleep and theta oscillations present during REM sleep have been considered of critical relevance for memory formation. Here transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) oscillating at 5 Hz, i.e., within the theta frequency range (theta-tDCS) is applied during NonREM and REM sleep. Theta-tDCS during NonREM sleep produced a global decrease in slow oscillatory activity conjoint with a local reduction of frontal slow EEG spindle power (8-12 Hz) and a decrement in consolidation of declarative memory, underlining the relevance of these cortical oscillations for sleep-dependent memory consolidation. In contrast, during REM sleep theta-tDCS appears to increase global gamma (25-45 Hz) activity, indicating a clear brain state-dependency of theta-tDCS. More generally, results demonstrate the suitability of oscillating-tDCS as a tool to analyze functions of endogenous EEG rhythms and underlying endogenous electric fields as well as the interactions between EEG rhythms of different frequencies. © 2011 Marshall et al.},

	abstract = {Slow-wave sleep (SWS) facilitates the consolidation of hippocampus-dependent declarative memory. Based on the standard two-stage memory model, we propose that memory consolidation during SWS represents a process of system consolidation which is orchestrated by the neocortical {\textless} 1 Hz electroencephalogram (EEG) slow oscillation and involves the reactivation of newly encoded representations and their subsequent redistribution from temporary hippocampal to neocortical long-term storage sites. Indeed, experimental induction of slow oscillations during non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep by slowly alternating transcranial current stimulation distinctly improves consolidation of declarative memory. The slow oscillations temporally group neuronal activity into up-states of strongly enhanced neuronal activity and down-states of neuronal silence. In a feed-forward efferent action, this grouping is induced not only in the neocortex but also in other structures relevant to consolidation, namely the thalamus generating 10-15. Hz spindles, and the hippocampus generating sharp wave-ripples, with the latter well known to accompany a replay of newly encoded memories taking place in hippocampal circuitries. The feed-forward synchronizing effect of the slow oscillation enables the formation of spindle-ripple events where ripples and accompanying reactivated hippocampal memory information become nested into the single troughs of spindles. Spindle-ripple events thus enable reactivated memory-related hippocampal information to be fed back to neocortical networks in the excitable slow oscillation up-state where they can induce enduring plastic synaptic changes underlying the effective formation of long-term memories. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Sleep is thought to be involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity in two ways: by enhancing local plastic processes underlying the consolidation of specific memories and by supporting global synaptic homeostasis. Here, we briefly summarize recent structural and functional studies examining sleep-associated changes in synaptic morphology and neural excitability. These studies point to a global down-scaling of synaptic strength across sleep while a subset of synapses increases in strength. Similarly, neuronal excitability on average decreases across sleep, whereas subsets of neurons increase firing rates across sleep. Whether synapse formation and excitability is down or upregulated across sleep appears to partly depend on the cell’s activity level during wakefulness. Processes of memory-specific upregulation of synapse formation and excitability are observed during slow wave sleep (SWS), whereas global downregulation resulting in elimination of synapses and decreased neural firing is linked to rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep). Studies of the excitation/inhibition balance in cortical circuits suggest that both processes are connected to a specific inhibitory regulation of cortical principal neurons, characterized by an enhanced perisomatic inhibition via parvalbumin positive (PV+) cells, together with a release from dendritic inhibition by somatostatin positive (SOM+) cells. Such shift towards increased perisomatic inhibition of principal cells appears to be a general motif which underlies the plastic synaptic changes observed during sleep, regardless of whether towards up or downregulation.},

	abstract = {Over more than a century of research has established the fact that sleep benefits the retention of memory. In this review we aim to comprehensively cover the field of "sleep and memory" research by providing a historical perspective on concepts and a discussion of more recent key findings. Whereas initial theories posed a passive role for sleep enhancing memories by protecting them from interfering stimuli, current theories highlight an active role for sleep in which memories undergo a process of system consolidation during sleep. Whereas older research concentrated on the role of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, recent work has revealed the importance of slow-wave sleep (SWS) for memory consolidation and also enlightened some of the underlying electrophysiological, neurochemical, and genetic mechanisms, as well as developmental aspects in these processes. Specifically, newer findings characterize sleep as a brain state optimizing memory consolidation, in opposition to the waking brain being optimized for encoding of memories. Consolidation originates from reactivation of recently encoded neuronal memory representations, which occur during SWS and transform respective representations for integration into long-term memory. Ensuing REM sleep may stabilize transformed memories. While elaborated with respect to hippocampus-dependent memories, the concept of an active redistribution of memory representations from networks serving as temporary store into long-term stores might hold also for non-hippocampus-dependent memory, and even for nonneuronal, i.e., immunological memories, giving rise to the idea that the offline consolidation of memory during sleep represents a principle of long-term memory formation established in quite different physiological systems. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.},

Consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory, in particular, is strongly supported by sleep3–5. Here we show that the formation of long-term representations in a rat model of non-hippocampus-dependent memory depends not only on sleep but also on activation of a hippocampus-dependent mechanism during sleep. Rats encoded non-hippocampus-dependent (novel-object recognition6–8) and hippocampus-dependent (object–place recognition) memories before a two-hour period of sleep or wakefulness. Memory was tested either immediately thereafter or remotely (after one or three weeks). Whereas object–place recognition memory was stronger for rats that had slept after encoding (rather than being awake) at both immediate and remote testing, novel-object recognition memory profited from sleep only three weeks after encoding, at which point it was preserved in rats that had slept after encoding but not in those that had been awake. Notably, inactivation of the hippocampus during post-encoding sleep by intrahippocampal injection of muscimol abolished the sleep-induced enhancement of remote novel-object recognition memory. By contrast, muscimol injection before remote retrieval or memory encoding had no effect on test performance, confirming that the encoding and retrieval of novel-object recognition memory are hippocampus-independent. Remote novel-object recognition memory was associated with spindle activity during post-encoding slow-wave sleep, consistent with the view that neuronal memory replay during slow-wave sleep contributes to long-term memory formation. Our results indicate that the hippocampus has an important role in long-term consolidation during sleep even for memories that have previously been considered hippocampus-independent.},

During subsequent sleep, some of the newly encoded memories are selected to be reactivated and redistributed toward networks serving as long-term store (e.g., neocortex), whereby memories become transformed into more general, schema-like representations. Here we asked whether sleep in non-mammalian species might play a comparable role for memory. The literature review revealed that sleep produces enhancing effects on memory in all non-mammalian species studied. Furthermore, across species some of the hallmarking features of active system consolidation were identified: Studies of filial imprinting in chicks suggest that a redistribution of imprinting memory toward long-term storage sites occurs during sleep; song learning in birds appears to be driven by reactivations of song representations during sleep; studies of bees demonstrated the selectivity of sleep-dependent consolidation, benefiting extinction but not original classical conditioning. Although overall fragmentary, first evidence in non-mammalian species suggests active system consolidation might be an evolutionary conserved function of sleep.},

We produced multiple different models that exhibit a triphasic pyloric rhythm over a range of temperatures and explored the dynamics of their currents and how they change with temperature. Temperature can produce smooth changes in the relative contributions of the currents to neural activity so that neurons and networks undergo graceful transitions in the mechanisms that give rise to their activity patterns.

The LP neuron is part of the pyloric network, a central pattern generator that normally oscillates with a period of ∼ 1 s. We used the dynamic clamp to create artificial rhythmic synaptic inputs of various periods and duty cycles in the LP neuron. Surprisingly, we found that the strength of PIR increased slowly over multiple cycles of synaptic input. Moreover, this increased excitability persisted for 10-20 s after the rhythmic inhibition was removed. These effects are considerably slower than the rhythmic activity typically observed in LP. Thus this slow postinhibitory rebound allows the neuron to adjust its level of excitability to the average level of inhibition over many cycles, and is another example of an intrinsic "short-term memory" mechanism.

At the same time, neurons can be highly sensitive to neuro-modulators. We find correlates of this dual robustness and sensitivity in a global analysis of the structure of a conductance-based model neuron. We vary the maximal conductance parameters of the model neuron and, for each set of parameters tested, characterize the activity pattern generated by the cell as silent, tonically firing, or bursting. Within the parameter space of the five maximal conductances of the model, we find directions, representing concerted changes in multiple conductances, along which the basic pattern of neural activity does not change. In other directions, relatively small concurrent changes in a few conductances can induce transitions between these activity patterns. The global structure of the conductance-space maps implies that neuromodulators that alter a sensitive set of conductances will have powerful, and possibly state-dependent, effects. Other modulators that may have no direct impact on the activity of the neuron may nevertheless change the effects of such direct modulators via this state dependence. Some of the results and predictions arising from the model studies are replicated and verified in recordings of stomatogastric ganglion neurons using the dynamic clamp.},

If neuronal identity is associated with stereotypical function, as is the case in genetically identical neurons or in unambiguously identified individual neurons, this variability poses a conundrum: How is activity the same if the components that generate it - ionic current levels - are different? In some cases, ionic current variability across similar neurons generates an output gradient. However, many neurons produce very similar output activity, despite substantial variability in ionic conductances. It appears that, in many such cells, conductance levels of one ionic current vary in proportion to the conductance levels of another current. As a result, in a population of neurons, these conductances appear to be correlated. Here, I review theoretical and experimental work that suggests that neuronal ionic current correlation can reduce the global ionic current variability and can contribute to functional stability. © 2014 The Author(s) 2014.},

	abstract = {1. The behavior of the mathematical model for the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG) developed in the previous paper was further studied. 2. The action of proctolin, a neuromodulatory peptide that acts directly on the LP neuron, was modeled. The effect of the proctolin-activated current (i(proc)) on the model neuron mimics the effects of proctolin on the isolated biological LP neuron. The depolarization and increased frequency of firing seen when i(proc) is activated are associated with changes in the relative contributions of the delayed rectifier (i(d)) and the Ca2+-activated outward current (i(o(Ca))) to the repolarization phase of the action potential. 3. The effects of turning off the A-current (i(A)) in the model were compared with those obtained by pharmacologically blocking i(A) in the biological neuron. i(A) appears to regulate action-potential frequency as well as postinhibitory rebound activity. 4. The role of i(A) on the rhythmic activity of the cell was studied by modifying several of its parameters while periodically activating a simulated synaptically activated conductance, i(syn). 5. The effects of manipulations of the maximal conductances (ḡ) for i(d) and i(o(Ca)) were studied. i(d) strongly influences action-potential frequency, whereas i(o(Ca)) strongly influences action-potential duration. 6. Modifications of the maximal conductance of the inward Ca2+ current (i(Ca)) were compared with the effects of blocking i(Ca) in the real cell. 7. The role of the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (i(h)) during ongoing rhythmic activity was assessed by periodically activating i(syn) while modifying i(h).},

Plasticity is also essential for the maintenance of stable patterns of activity in the face of variable environmental and internal conditions. Previous theoretical and experimental results suggest that neurons stabilize their activity by altering the number or characteristics of ion channels to regulate their intrinsic electrical properties. We present both experimental and modeling evidence to show that activity-dependent regulation of conductances, operating at the level of individual neurons, can also stabilize network activity. These results indicate that the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab can generate a characteristic rhythmic pattern of activity in two fundamentally different modes of operation. In one mode, the rhythm is strictly conditional on the presence of neuromodulatory afferents from adjacent ganglia. In the other, it is independent of neuromodulatory input but relies on newly developed intrinsic properties of the component neurons.},

To explore the validity of this procedure, we studied the behavior of a conductance-based model neuron with five voltage-dependent conductances. We randomly varied the maximal conductance of each of the active currents in the model and identified sets of maximal conductances that generate bursting neurons that fire a single action potential at the peak of a slow membrane potential depolarization. A model constructed using the means of the maximal conductances of this population is not itself a one-spike burster, but rather fires three action potentials per burst. Averaging fails because the maximal conductances of the population of one-spike bursters lie in a highly concave region of parameter space that does not contain its mean. This demonstrates that averages over multiple samples can fail to characterize a system whose behavior depends on interactions involving a number of highly variable components.},

We constructed a five-cell circuit in which a neuron is at the center of the circuit and the remaining neurons form two distinct oscillatory subnetworks. All neurons were modeled as modified Morris-Lecar models with a hyperpolarization-activated conductance (gh) in addition to calcium (gCa), potassium (gK), and leak conductances. We determined the effects of varying gCa, gK, and gh on the frequency, amplitude, and duty cycle of a single neuron oscillator. The frequency of the single neuron was highest when the gK and gh conductances were high and gCa was moderate whereas, in the traditional Morris-Lecar model, the highest frequencies occur when both gK and gCa are high. We randomly sampled parameter space to find 143 hub oscillators with nearly identical frequencies but with disparate maximal conductance, duty cycles, and burst amplitudes, and then embedded each of these hub neurons into networks with different sets of synaptic parameters. For one set of network parameters, circuit behavior was virtually identical regardless of the underlying conductances of the hub neuron. For a different set of network parameters, circuit behavior varied with the maximal conductances of the hub neuron. This demonstrates that neuromodulation of a single target neuron may dramatically alter the performance of an entire network when the network is in one state, but have almost no effect when the circuit is in a different state.},

	abstract = {Experimental observations reveal that the expression levels of different ion channels vary across neurons of a defined type, even when these neurons exhibit stereotyped electrical properties. However, there are robust correlations between different ion channel expression levels, although the mechanisms that determine these correlations are unknown. Using generic model neurons, we show that correlated conductance expression can emerge from simple homeostatic control mechanisms that couple expression rates of individual conductances to cellular readouts of activity. The correlations depend on the relative rates of expression of different conductances. Thus, variability is consistent with homeostatic regulation and the structure of this variability reveals quantitative relations between regulation dynamics of different conductances. Furthermore, we show that homeostatic regulation is remarkably insensitive to the details that couple the regulation of a given conductance to overall neuronal activity because of degeneracy in the function of multiple conductances and can be robust to "antihomeostatic" regulation of a subset of conductances expressed in a cell.},

From generic assumptions about the molecular biology underlying channel expression, we derive a simple model and show how it encodes an "activity set point" in single neurons. The model generates diverse self-regulating cell types and relates correlations in conductance expression observed invivo to underlying channel expression rates. Synaptic as well as intrinsic conductances can be regulated to make aself-assembling central pattern generator network;thus, network-level homeostasis can emerge fromcell-autonomous regulation rules. Finally, we demonstrate that the outcome of homeostatic regulation depends on the complement of ion channels expressed in cells: in some cases, loss of specific ion channels can be compensated; in others, the homeostatic mechanism itself causes pathological loss of function. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Excitability-a threshold governed transient in transmembrane voltage is a fundamental physiological process that controls the function of the heart, endocrine, muscles and neuronal tissues. The 1950's Hodgkin and Huxley explicit formulation provides a mathematical framework for understanding excitability, as the consequence of the properties of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels. The Hodgkin-Huxley model is more sensitive to parametric variations of protein densities and kinetics than biological systems whose excitability is apparently more robust. It is generally assumed that the model's sensitivity reflects missing functional relations between its parameters or other components present in biological systems. Here we experimentally construct excitable membranes using the dynamic clamp and voltage-gated potassium ionic channels (Kv1.3) expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We take advantage of a theoretically derived phase diagram, where the phenomenon of excitability is reduced to two dimensions defined as combinations of the Hodgkin-Huxley model parameters. This biological-computational hybrid enabled us to explore functional relations in the parameter space, experimentally validate the phase diagram of the Hodgkin-Huxley model, and demonstrate activity-dependence and hysteretic dynamics due to the impacts of slow inacti-vation kinetics. The experimental results presented here provide new insights into the gap between technology-guided high-dimensional descriptions , and a lower, physiological dimensionality, within which biological function is embedded. The canonical Hodgkin-Huxley model of excitability [1] consists of four dynam-ical variables (membrane voltage and three protein state variables) and more than ten parameters. Several of the parameters represent actual, measurable physical entities (membrane capacitance, ionic concentrations inside and outside the cell, densities of ionic channel membrane proteins). Other parameters shape the six exponential functions relating membrane voltage to probabilities of transitions between protein states [2-4]. The considerable sensitivity of the model to parametric variations-especially protein densities and kinetics-is not on par with the robustness of many biological systems, as revealed in experiments showing a high degree of resilience to variation in values of measurable parameters [5-8].

In contrast, increasing the duration of the synaptic conductance pulses always led to changes in the burst period, indicating that neural oscillators are sensitive to changes in the duration of synaptic input but are not sensitive to changes in the strength of synaptic inputs above a certain conductance. This saturation of the response to progressively stronger synaptic inputs occurs not only in bursting neurons but also in tonically spiking neurons. We identified inward currents at hyperpolarized potentials as the cause of the saturation in the model neuron. Our findings imply that activity-dependent or modulator-induced changes in synaptic strength are not necessarily accompanied by changes in the functional impact of a synapse on the timing of postsynaptic spikes or bursts.},

The relationship between the magnitudes of these membrane conductances and the response of the oscillating neurons to synaptic input has not yet been fully or systematically explored. We examined this relationship using the phase resetting curve (PRC), which summarizes the change in the cycle period of a neuronal oscillator as a function of the input’s timing within the oscillation. We first utilized a large database of single-compartment model neurons to determine the effect of individual membrane conductances on PRC shape; we found that the effects vary across conductance space, but on average, the hyperpolarization-activated and leak conductances advance the PRC. We next investigated how membrane conductances affect PRCs of the isolated pacemaker kernel in the pyloric circuit of Cancer borealis by: (1) tabulating PRCs while using dynamic clamp to artificially add varying levels of specific conductances, and (2) tabulating PRCs before and after blocking the endogenous hyperpolarization-activated current. We additionally used a previously described four-compartment model to determine how the location of the hyperpolarization-activated conductance influences that current’s effect on the PRC. We report that while dynamic-clamp-injected leak current has much smaller effects on the PRC than suggested by the single-compartment model, an increase in the hyperpolarization-activated conductance both advances and reduces the noisiness of the PRC in the pacemaker kernel of the pyloric circuit in both modeling and experimental studies.},

Because these currents are nonlinear, it can be difficult to determine the role each current plays in determining how a neuron fires. The lateral pyloric (LP) neuron of the stomatogastric ganglion of decapod crustaceans has been studied extensively biophysically. We constructed ∼600,000 versions of a four-compartment model of the LP neuron and distributed 11 different currents into the compartments. From these, we selected ∼1300 models that match well the electrophysiological properties of the biological neuron. Interestingly, correlations that were seen in the expression of channel mRNA in biological studies were not found across the ∼1300 admissible LP neuron models, suggesting that the electrical phenotype does not require these correlations. We used cubic fits of the function from maximal conductances to a series of electrophysiological properties to ask which conductances predominantly influence input conductance, resting membrane potential, resting spike rate, phasing of activity in response to rhythmic inhibition, and several other properties. In all cases, multiple conductances contribute to the measured property, and the combinations of currents that strongly influence each property differ.

	doi = {10.1152/jn.00622.2011},
	abstract = {Neuronal identity depends on the regulated expression of numerous molecular components, especially ionic channels, which determine the electrical signature of a neuron. Such regulation depends on at least two key factors, activity itself and neuromodulatory input. Neuronal electrical activity can modify the expression of ionic currents in homeostatic or nonhomeostatic fashion. Neuromodulators typically modify activity by regulating the properties or expression levels of subsets of ionic channels. In the stomatogastric system of crustaceans, both types of regulation have been demonstrated. Furthermore, the regulation of the coordinated expression of ionic currents and the channels that carry these currents has been recently reported in diverse neuronal systems, with neuromodulators not only controlling the absolute levels of ionic current expression but also, over long periods of time, appearing to modify their correlated expression. We hypothesize that neuromodulators may regulate the correlated expression of ion channels at multiple levels and in a cell-type-dependent fashion. We report that in two identified neuronal types, three ionic currents are linearly correlated in a pairwise manner, suggesting their coexpression or direct interactions, under normal neuromodulatory conditions. In each cell, some currents remain correlated after neuromodulatory input is removed, whereas the correlations between the other pairs are either lost or altered. Interestingly, in each cell, a different suite of currents change their correlation. At the transcript level we observe distinct alterations in correlations between channel mRNA amounts, including one of the cell types lacking a correlation under normal neuromodulatory conditions and then gaining the correlation when neuromodulators are removed. Synaptic activity does not appear to contribute, with one possible exception, to the correlated expression of either ionic currents or of the transcripts that code for the respective channels. We conclude that neuromodulators regulate the correlated expression of ion channels at both the transcript and the protein levels. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.},

	abstract = {Although sleep-dependent consolidation and its neurochemical underpinnings have been strongly researched, less is known about how consolidation during sleep affects subsequent learning. Since sleep enhances memory, it can be expected to pro-actively interfere with learning after sleep, in particular of similar materials. This pro-active interference should be enhanced by substances that benefit consolidation during sleep, such as d-cycloserine. We tested this hypothesis in two groups (Sleep, Wake) of young healthy participants receiving on one occasion d-cycloserine (175 mg) and on another occasion placebo, according to a double-blind balanced crossover design. Treatment was administered after participants had learned a set of word pairs (A–B list) and before nocturnal retention periods of sleep vs. wakefulness. After d-cycloserine blood plasma levels had dropped to negligible amounts, i.e., the next day in the evening, participants learned, in three sequential runs, new sets of word pairs. One list—to enhance interference—consisted of the same cue words as the original set paired with a new target word (A–C list) and the other of completely new cue words (D–E set). Unexpectedly, during post-retention learning the A–C interference list was generally better learned than the completely new D–E list, which suggests that consolidation of previously encoded similar material enhances memory integration rather than pro-active interference. Consistent with this view, new learning of word pairs was better after sleep than wakefulness. Similarly, d-cycloserine generally enhanced learning of new word pairs, compared to placebo. This effect being independent of sleep or wakefulness, leads us to speculate that d-cycloserine, in addition to enhancing sleep-dependent consolidation, might mediate a time-dependent process of active forgetting.},

	abstract = {Memory consolidation is a dynamic process. Reconsolidation theory assumes that reactivation during wakefulness transiently destabilizes memories, requiring them to reconsolidate in order to persist. Memory reactivation also occurs during slow-wave sleep (SWS) and is assumed to underlie the consolidating effect of sleep. Here, we tested whether the same principle of transient destabilization applies to memory reactivation during SWS. We reactivated memories in humans by presenting associated odor cues either during SWS or wakefulness. Reactivation was followed by an interference task to probe memory stability. As we expected, reactivation during waking destabilized memories. In contrast, reactivation during SWS immediately stabilized memories, thereby directly increasing their resistance to interference. Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that reactivation during SWS mainly activated hippocampal and posterior cortical regions, whereas reactivation during wakefulness primarily activated prefrontal cortical areas. Our results show that reactivation of memory serves distinct functions depending on the brain state of wakefulness or sleep. © 2011 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Slow-wave sleep (SWS) facilitates the consolidation of hippocampus-dependent declarative memory. Based on the standard two-stage memory model, we propose that memory consolidation during SWS represents a process of system consolidation which is orchestrated by the neocortical {\textless} 1 Hz electroencephalogram (EEG) slow oscillation and involves the reactivation of newly encoded representations and their subsequent redistribution from temporary hippocampal to neocortical long-term storage sites. Indeed, experimental induction of slow oscillations during non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep by slowly alternating transcranial current stimulation distinctly improves consolidation of declarative memory. The slow oscillations temporally group neuronal activity into up-states of strongly enhanced neuronal activity and down-states of neuronal silence. In a feed-forward efferent action, this grouping is induced not only in the neocortex but also in other structures relevant to consolidation, namely the thalamus generating 10-15. Hz spindles, and the hippocampus generating sharp wave-ripples, with the latter well known to accompany a replay of newly encoded memories taking place in hippocampal circuitries. The feed-forward synchronizing effect of the slow oscillation enables the formation of spindle-ripple events where ripples and accompanying reactivated hippocampal memory information become nested into the single troughs of spindles. Spindle-ripple events thus enable reactivated memory-related hippocampal information to be fed back to neocortical networks in the excitable slow oscillation up-state where they can induce enduring plastic synaptic changes underlying the effective formation of long-term memories. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Sleep supports memory consolidation. Based on studies in mammals, sleep-dependent consolidation has been conceptualized as 'active system consolidation'. During waking, information is encoded into an initial store (hippocampus). During subsequent sleep, some of the newly encoded memories are selected to be reactivated and redistributed toward networks serving as long-term store (e.g., neocortex), whereby memories become transformed into more general, schema-like representations. Here we asked whether sleep in non-mammalian species might play a comparable role for memory. The literature review revealed that sleep produces enhancing effects on memory in all non-mammalian species studied. Furthermore, across species some of the hallmarking features of active system consolidation were identified: Studies of filial imprinting in chicks suggest that a redistribution of imprinting memory toward long-term storage sites occurs during sleep; song learning in birds appears to be driven by reactivations of song representations during sleep; studies of bees demonstrated the selectivity of sleep-dependent consolidation, benefiting extinction but not original classical conditioning. Although overall fragmentary, first evidence in non-mammalian species suggests active system consolidation might be an evolutionary conserved function of sleep.},

	abstract = {Recently, compelling evidence has accumulated that links sleep to learning and memory. Sleep has been identified as a state that optimizes the consolidation of newly acquired information in memory. Consolidation is an active process that is presumed to rely on the covert reactivation and reorganization of newly encoded representations. Hippocampus-dependent memories benefit primarily from slow-wave sleep (SWS), whereas memories not depending on the hippocampus show greater gains over periods containing high amounts of rapid eye movement sleep. One way sleep does this is by establishing different patterns of neurotransmitters and neurohormone secretion between sleep stages. Another central role for consolidating memories is played by the slow oscillation, that is, the oscillating field potential change dominating SWS. The emergence of slow oscillations in neocortical networks depends on the prior use of these networks for encoding of information. Via efferent pathways, they synchronize the occurrence of sharp wave ripples accompanying memory reactivations in the hippocampus with thalamocortical spindle activity. Thus, hippocampal memories are fed back into neocortical networks at a time when these networks are depolarized and, because of concurrent spindle activity, can most sensitively react to these inputs with plastic changes underlying the formation of long-term memory representations.

	abstract = {Over more than a century of research has established the fact that sleep benefits the retention of memory. In this review we aim to comprehensively cover the field of "sleep and memory" research by providing a historical perspective on concepts and a discussion of more recent key findings. Whereas initial theories posed a passive role for sleep enhancing memories by protecting them from interfering stimuli, current theories highlight an active role for sleep in which memories undergo a process of system consolidation during sleep. Whereas older research concentrated on the role of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, recent work has revealed the importance of slow-wave sleep (SWS) for memory consolidation and also enlightened some of the underlying electrophysiological, neurochemical, and genetic mechanisms, as well as developmental aspects in these processes. Specifically, newer findings characterize sleep as a brain state optimizing memory consolidation, in opposition to the waking brain being optimized for encoding of memories. Consolidation originates from reactivation of recently encoded neuronal memory representations, which occur during SWS and transform respective representations for integration into long-term memory. Ensuing REM sleep may stabilize transformed memories. While elaborated with respect to hippocampus-dependent memories, the concept of an active redistribution of memory representations from networks serving as temporary store into long-term stores might hold also for non-hippocampus-dependent memory, and even for nonneuronal, i.e., immunological memories, giving rise to the idea that the offline consolidation of memory during sleep represents a principle of long-term memory formation established in quite different physiological systems. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.},

The slow oscillations occurring during NonREM sleep and theta oscillations present during REM sleep have been considered of critical relevance for memory formation. Here transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) oscillating at 5 Hz, i.e., within the theta frequency range (theta-tDCS) is applied during NonREM and REM sleep. Theta-tDCS during NonREM sleep produced a global decrease in slow oscillatory activity conjoint with a local reduction of frontal slow EEG spindle power (8-12 Hz) and a decrement in consolidation of declarative memory, underlining the relevance of these cortical oscillations for sleep-dependent memory consolidation. In contrast, during REM sleep theta-tDCS appears to increase global gamma (25-45 Hz) activity, indicating a clear brain state-dependency of theta-tDCS. More generally, results demonstrate the suitability of oscillating-tDCS as a tool to analyze functions of endogenous EEG rhythms and underlying endogenous electric fields as well as the interactions between EEG rhythms of different frequencies. © 2011 Marshall et al.},

	abstract = {Sleep is thought to be involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity in two ways: by enhancing local plastic processes underlying the consolidation of specific memories and by supporting global synaptic homeostasis. Here, we briefly summarize recent structural and functional studies examining sleep-associated changes in synaptic morphology and neural excitability. These studies point to a global down-scaling of synaptic strength across sleep while a subset of synapses increases in strength. Similarly, neuronal excitability on average decreases across sleep, whereas subsets of neurons increase firing rates across sleep. Whether synapse formation and excitability is down or upregulated across sleep appears to partly depend on the cell’s activity level during wakefulness. Processes of memory-specific upregulation of synapse formation and excitability are observed during slow wave sleep (SWS), whereas global downregulation resulting in elimination of synapses and decreased neural firing is linked to rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep). Studies of the excitation/inhibition balance in cortical circuits suggest that both processes are connected to a specific inhibitory regulation of cortical principal neurons, characterized by an enhanced perisomatic inhibition via parvalbumin positive (PV+) cells, together with a release from dendritic inhibition by somatostatin positive (SOM+) cells. Such shift towards increased perisomatic inhibition of principal cells appears to be a general motif which underlies the plastic synaptic changes observed during sleep, regardless of whether towards up or downregulation.},

This view received indirect support by findings in humans of sleep enhancing TMS-evoked plasticity and capabilities for encoding new information.

After 36 h (including a night allowing recovery sleep) retrieval was tested. Compared with wakefulness, post-learning sleep enhanced retention for the 160 word-pair condition (p {\textless} 0.01), importantly, this effect completely vanished for the 320 word-pair condition. This result indicates a limited capacity for sleep-dependent memory consolidation, which is consistent with an active system consolidation view on sleep's role for memory, if it is complemented by processes of active forgetting and/or gist abstraction. Whereas the absolute benefit from sleep should have increased with increasing amounts of successfully encoded items, if sleep only passively protected memory from interference. Moreover, the finding that retention performance was significantly diminished for the 320 word-pair condition compared to the 160 word-pair condition in the sleep group, makes it tempting to speculate that with increasing loads of information encoded during wakefulness, sleep might favor processes of forgetting over consolidation.},

Combining optogenetics with a closed-loop stimulation approach in mice, we show here that only thalamic spindles induced in-phase with cortical slow oscillation up-states, but not out-of-phase-induced spindles, improve consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory during sleep. Whereas optogenetically stimulated spindles were as efficient as spontaneous spindles in nesting hippocampal ripples within their excitable troughs, stimulation in-phase with the slow oscillation up-state increased spindle co-occurrence and frontal spindle-ripple co-occurrence, eventually resulting in increased triple coupling of slow oscillation-spindle-ripple events. In-phase optogenetic suppression of thalamic spindles impaired hippocampus-dependent memory. Our results suggest a causal role for thalamic sleep spindles in hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation, conveyed through triple coupling of slow oscillations, spindles, and ripples. Latchoumane et al. demonstrate a causal role of sleep spindles in memory formation.

Consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory, in particular, is strongly supported by sleep3–5. Here we show that the formation of long-term representations in a rat model of non-hippocampus-dependent memory depends not only on sleep but also on activation of a hippocampus-dependent mechanism during sleep. Rats encoded non-hippocampus-dependent (novel-object recognition6–8) and hippocampus-dependent (object–place recognition) memories before a two-hour period of sleep or wakefulness. Memory was tested either immediately thereafter or remotely (after one or three weeks). Whereas object–place recognition memory was stronger for rats that had slept after encoding (rather than being awake) at both immediate and remote testing, novel-object recognition memory profited from sleep only three weeks after encoding, at which point it was preserved in rats that had slept after encoding but not in those that had been awake. Notably, inactivation of the hippocampus during post-encoding sleep by intrahippocampal injection of muscimol abolished the sleep-induced enhancement of remote novel-object recognition memory. By contrast, muscimol injection before remote retrieval or memory encoding had no effect on test performance, confirming that the encoding and retrieval of novel-object recognition memory are hippocampus-independent. Remote novel-object recognition memory was associated with spindle activity during post-encoding slow-wave sleep, consistent with the view that neuronal memory replay during slow-wave sleep contributes to long-term memory formation. Our results indicate that the hippocampus has an important role in long-term consolidation during sleep even for memories that have previously been considered hippocampus-independent.},

	abstract = {Sleep is known to support the consolidation of newly encoded and initially labile memories. Once consolidated, remote memories can return to a labile state upon reactivation and need to become reconsolidated in order to persist. Here we asked whether sleep also benefits the reconsolidation of remote memories after their reactivation and how reconsolidation during sleep compares to sleep-dependent consolidation processes. In three groups, participants were trained on a visuo-spatial learning task in the presence of a contextual odor. Participants in the ‘reconsolidation’ group learned the task on day 1. On day 2, they were subjected to a reactivation procedure by presenting the odor cue and a mock recall test in the learning context before a 40-min sleep or wake period. Participants in the ‘remote consolidation’ group followed the same procedure but did not receive reactivation on day 2. Participants in the ‘recent consolidation’ group skipped the procedure on day 1 and learned the task immediately before the sleep or wake period. After the sleep or wake interval, memory stability was tested in all subjects. The results show that this short 40-min sleep period significantly facilitated the reconsolidation of reactivated memories, whereas the consolidation of non-reactivated remote memories was less affected and recently encoded memories did not benefit at all. These findings tentatively suggest that sleep has a beneficial effect on the reconsolidation of remote memories, acting at a faster rate than sleep-associated consolidation.},

In experimental protocols inducing plasticity, the imposed spike trains are typically regular and the relative timing between every presynaptic and postsynaptic spike is fixed. This is at odds with firing patterns observed in the cortex of intact animals, where cells fire irregularly and the timing between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes varies. To investigate synaptic changes elicited by in vivo-like firing, we used numerical simulations and mathematical analysis of synaptic plasticity models. We found that the influence of spike timing on plasticity is weaker than expected from regular stimulation protocols. Moreover, when neurons fire irregularly, synaptic changes induced by precise spike timing can be equivalently induced by a modest firing rate variation. Our findings bridge the gap between existing results on synaptic plasticity and plasticity occurring in vivo, and challenge the dominant role of spike timing in plasticity.},

	abstract = {Most models of learning and memory assume that memories are maintained in neuronal circuits by persistent synaptic modifications induced by specific patterns of pre- and postsynaptic activity. For this scenario to be viable, synaptic modifications must survive the ubiquitous ongoing activity present in neural circuits in vivo. In this paper, we investigate the time scales of memory maintenance in a calcium-based synaptic plasticity model that has been shown recently to be able to fit different experimental data-sets from hippocampal and neocortical preparations. We find that in the presence of background activity on the order of 1 Hz parameters that fit pyramidal layer 5 neocortical data lead to a very fast decay of synaptic efficacy, with time scales of minutes. We then identify two ways in which this memory time scale can be extended: (i) the extracellular calcium concentration in the experiments used to fit the model are larger than estimated concentrations in vivo. Lowering extracellular calcium concentration to in vivo levels leads to an increase in memory time scales of several orders of magnitude; (ii) adding a bistability mechanism so that each synapse has two stable states at sufficiently low background activity leads to a further boost in memory time scale, since memory decay is no longer described by an exponential decay from an initial state, but by an escape from a potential well. We argue that both features are expected to be present in synapses in vivo. These results are obtained first in a single synapse connecting two independent Poisson neurons, and then in simulations of a large network of excitatory and inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons. Our results emphasise the need for studying plasticity at physiological extracellular calcium concentration, and highlight the role of synaptic bi- or multistability in the stability of learned synaptic structures.},

Similar to the requirements of LTD, we find that high-frequency bursts are necessary to trigger LTP and that this burst-dependent plasticity depends on presynaptic NMDA receptors and nitric oxide (NO) signaling. We provide direct evidence for calcium entry through presynaptic NMDA receptors in a subpopulation of parallel fiber varicosities. Finally, we develop and experimentally verify a mechanistic plasticity model based on NO and calcium signaling.

	abstract = {The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays a key role in the induction of long-term postsynaptic modifications following calcium entry. Experiments suggest that these long-term synaptic changes are all-or-none switch-like events between discrete states. The biochemical network involving CaMKII and its regulating protein signaling cascade has been hypothesized to durably maintain the evoked synaptic state in the form of a bistable switch. However, it is still unclear whether experimental LTP/LTD protocols lead to corresponding transitions between the two states in realistic models of such a network. We present a detailed biochemical model of the CaMKII autophosphorylation and the protein signaling cascade governing the CaMKII dephosphorylation. As previously shown, two stable states of the CaMKII phosphorylation level exist at resting intracellular calcium concentration, and high calcium transients can switch the system from the weakly phosphorylated (DOWN) to the highly phosphorylated (UP) state of the CaMKII (similar to a LTP event). We show here that increased CaMKII dephosphorylation activity at intermediate Ca2+ concentrations can lead to switching from the UP to the DOWN state (similar to a LTD event). This can be achieved if protein phosphatase activity promoting CaMKII dephosphorylation activates at lower Ca2+ levels than kinase activity. Finally, it is shown that the CaMKII system can qualitatively reproduce results of plasticity outcomes in response to spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and presynaptic stimulation protocols. This shows that the CaMKII protein network can account for both induction, through LTP/LTD-like transitions, and storage, due to its bistability, of synaptic changes. © 2007 Graupner and Brunel.},

	abstract = {Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of pyramidal cell connections are among the key mechanisms underlying learning and memory in the brain. Despite their important role, only a few of these connections have been characterized in terms of LTP/LTD dynamics, such as the one between layer 5 thick-tufted pyramidal cells (L5-TTPCs). Comparing the available evidence on different pyramidal connection types reveals a large variability of experimental outcomes, possibly indicating the presence of connection-type-specific mechanisms. Here, we show that a calcium-based plasticity rule regulating L5-TTPC synapses holds also for several other pyramidal-to-pyramidal connections in a digital model of neocortical tissue. In particular, we show that synaptic physiology, cell morphology and innervation patterns jointly determine LTP/LTD dynamics without requiring a different model or parameter set for each connection type. We therefore propose that a similar set of plasticity mechanisms is shared by seemingly very different neocortical connections and that only a small number of targeted experiments is required for generating a complete map of synaptic plasticity dynamics int he neocortex.

	abstract = {Spike-timing–dependent plasticity (STDP) is considered as a primary mechanism underlying formation of new memories during learning. Despite the growing interest in activity-dependent plasticity, it is still unclear whether synaptic plasticity rules inferred from in vitro experiments are correct in physiological conditions. The abnormally high calcium concentration used in in vitro studies of STDP suggests that in vivo plasticity rules may differ significantly from in vitro experiments, especially since STDP depends strongly on calcium for induction. We therefore studied here the influence of extracellular calcium on synaptic plasticity. Using a combination of experimental (patch-clamp recording and Ca2+ imaging at CA3-CA1 synapses) and theoretical approaches, we show here that the classic STDP rule in which pairs of single pre- and postsynaptic action potentials induce synaptic modifications is not valid in the physiological Ca2+ range. Rather, we found that these pairs of single stimuli are unable to induce any synaptic modification in 1.3 and 1.5 mM calcium and lead to depression in 1.8 mM. Plasticity can only be recovered when bursts of postsynaptic spikes are used, or when neurons fire at sufficiently high frequency. In conclusion, the STDP rule is profoundly altered in physiological Ca2+, but specific activity regimes restore a classical STDP profile.},

Here, we propose a calcium-based model of a synapse in which potentiation and depression are activated above calcium thresholds. We show that this model gives rise to a large diversity of spike timing-dependent plasticity curves, most of which have been observed experimentally in different systems. It accounts quantitatively for plasticity outcomes evoked by protocols involving patterns with variable spike timing and firing rate in hippocampus and neocortex. Furthermore, it allows us to predict that differences in plasticity outcomes in different studies are due to differences in parameters defining the calcium dynamics. The model provides a mechanistic understanding of how various stimulation protocols provoke specific synaptic changes through the dynamics of calcium concentration and thresholds implementing in simplified fashion protein signaling cascades, leading to long-term potentiation and long-term depression. The combination of biophysical realism and analytical tractability makes it the ideal candidate to study plasticity at the synapse, neuron, and network levels.},

Unfortunately, those paired-based STDP models cannot account for the dependence on the repetition frequency of the pairs of spike. Moreover, those STDP models cannot reproduce recent triplet and quadruplet experiments. Here, we examine a triplet rule (i.e., a rule which considers sets of three spikes, i.e., two pre and one post or one pre and two post) and compare it to classical pair-based STDP learning rules. With such a triplet rule, it is possible to fit experimental data from visual cortical slices as well as from hippocampal cultures. Moreover, when assuming stochastic spike trains, the triplet learning rule can be mapped to a Bienenstock-Cooper- Munro learning rule. Copyright © 2006 Society for Neuroscience.},

This organization emerges during early postnatal development through patterned spontaneous activity and manifests both locally where nearby synapses are significantly correlated, and globally with distance to the soma. We propose a biophysically motivated synaptic plasticity model to dissect the mechanistic origins of this organization during development, and elucidate synaptic clustering of different stimulus features in the adult. Our model captures local clustering of orientation in ferret vs. receptive field overlap in mouse visual cortex based on the cortical magnification of visual space. Including a back-propagating action potential explains branch clustering heterogeneity in the ferret, and produces a global retinotopy gradient from soma to dendrite in the mouse. Therefore, our framework suggests that sub-cellular precision in connectivity can already be established in development, and unifies different aspects of synaptic organization across species and scales.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous retinal activity (known as "waves") remodels synaptic connectivity to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) during development. Analysis of retinal waves recorded with multielectrode arrays in mouse suggested that a cue for the segregation of functionally distinct (ON and OFF) retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the LGN may be a desynchronization in their firing, where ON cells precede OFF cells by one second. Using the recorded retinal waves as input, with two different modeling approaches we explore timing-based plasticity rules for the evolution of synaptic weights to identify key features underlying ON/OFF segregation. First, we analytically derive a linear model for the evolution of ON and OFF weights, to understand how synaptic plasticity rules extract input firing properties to guide segregation. Second, we simulate postsynaptic activity with a nonlinear integrate-and-fire model to compare findings with the linear model. We find that spike-time-dependent plasticity, which modifies synaptic weights based on millisecond-long timing and order of pre- and postsynaptic spikes, fails to segregate ON and OFF retinal inputs in the absence of normalization. Implementing homeostatic mechanisms results in segregation, but only with carefully-tuned parameters. Furthermore, extending spike integration timescales to match the second-long input correlation timescales always leads to ON segregation because ON cells fire before OFF cells. We show that burst-time-dependent plasticity can robustly guide ON/OFF segregation in the LGN without normalization, by integrating pre- and postsynaptic bursts irrespective of their firing order and over second-long timescales. We predict that an LGN neuron will become ON- or OFF-responsive based on a local competition of the firing patterns of neighboring RGCs connecting to it. Finally, we demonstrate consistency with ON/OFF segregation in ferret, despite differences in the firing properties of retinal waves. Our model suggests that diverse input statistics of retinal waves can be robustly interpreted by a burst-based rule, which underlies retinogeniculate plasticity across different species. © 2009 Gjorgjieva et al.},

This feature is a key property of the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) synaptic learning rule, which has been shown tomaximize the selectivity of the postsynaptic neuron, and thereby offers a possible explanation for experience-dependent cortical plasticity such as orientation selectivity. However, the BCM framework is rate-based and a significant amount of recent work has shown that synaptic plasticity also depends on the precise timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes. Here we consider a triplet model of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) that depends on the interactions of three precisely timed spikes. Triplet STDP has been shown to describe plasticity experiments that the classical STDP rule, based on pairs of spikes, has failed to capture. In the case of rate-based patterns, we show a tight correspondence between the triplet STDP rule and the BCM rule. We analytically demonstrate the selectivity property of the triplet STDP rule for orthogonal inputs and perform numerical simulations for nonorthogonal inputs. Moreover, in contrast to BCM, we show that triplet STDP can also induce selectivity for input patterns consisting of higher-order spatiotemporal correlations, which exist in natural stimuli and have been measured in the brain. We show that this sensitivity to higher-order correlations can be used to develop direction and speed selectivity.},

	abstract = {Rate coding and phase coding are the two major coding modes seen in the brain. For these two modes, network dynamics must either have a wide distribution of frequencies for rate coding, or a narrow one to achieve stability in phase dynamics for phase coding. Acetylcholine (ACh) is a potent regulator of neural excitability. Acting through the muscarinic receptor, ACh reduces the magnitude of the potassium M-current, a hyperpolarizing current that builds up as neurons fire. The M-current contributes to several excitability features of neurons, becoming a major player in facilitating the transition between Type 1 (integrator) and Type 2 (resonator) excitability. In this paper we argue that this transition enables a dynamic switch between rate coding and phase coding as levels of ACh release change. When a network is in a high ACh state variations in synaptic inputs will lead to a wider distribution of firing rates across the network and this distribution will reflect the network structure or pattern of external input to the network. When ACh is low, network frequencies become narrowly distributed and the structure of a network or pattern of external inputs will be represented through phase relationships between firing neurons. This work provides insights into how modulation of neuronal features influences network dynamics and information processing across brain states.},

Here we show how coordinated long-term plasticity calibrates populations of excitatory-inhibitory inputs onto mouse auditory cortical pyramidal neurons. Pairing pre- and postsynaptic activity induced plasticity at paired inputs and different forms of heterosynaptic plasticity at the strongest unpaired synapses, which required minutes of activity and dendritic Ca2+ signaling to be computed. Theoretical analyses demonstrated how the relative rate of heterosynaptic plasticity could normalize and stabilize synaptic strengths to achieve any possible excitatory-inhibitory correlation.

Strikingly, our data reveal that functional pairwise correlations and their structure are subject to homeostatic regulation. Using a computational model, we demonstrate that the interplay of different plasticity and homeostatic mechanisms can capture the initial drop and delayed recovery of firing rates and correlations observed experimentally. Moreover, our model indicates that synaptic scaling is crucial for the recovery of correlations and network structure, while intrinsic plasticity is essential for the rebound of firing rates, suggesting that synaptic scaling and intrinsic plasticity can serve distinct functions in homeostatically regulating network dynamics.},

Here we use a combination of real-time sleep classification, ex vivo measurements of postsynaptic strength, and in vivo optogenetic monitoring of thalamocortical synapses in primary visual cortex (V1) to ask whether sleep and wake states can constitutively drive synaptic plasticity within neocortical circuits. We found that miniature EPSCs onto L4 or L2/3 pyramidal neurons were stable across sleep and wake dense epochs in both V1 and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Further, chronic monitoring of thalamocortical synaptic efficacy in V1 of freely behaving animals revealed remarkable stability of thalamocortical transmission across prolonged natural sleep and wake epochs. Together these data provide strong evidence against the view that sleep drives widespread constitutive weakening of excitatory synaptic strengths.},

	abstract = {Developing neuronal networks display spontaneous bursts of action potentials that are necessary for circuit organization and tuning. While spontaneous activity has been shown to instruct map formation in sensory circuits, it is unknown whether it plays a role in the organization of motor networks that produce rhythmic output. Using computational modeling, we investigate how recurrent networks of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations assemble to produce robust patterns of unidirectional and precisely timed propagating activity during organism locomotion. One example is provided by the motor network in Drosophila larvae, which generates propagating peristaltic waves of muscle contractions during crawling. We examine two activity-dependent models, which tune weak network connectivity based on spontaneous activity patterns: a Hebbian model, where coincident activity in neighboring populations strengthens connections between them; and a homeostatic model, where connections are homeostatically regulated to maintain a constant level of excitatory activity based on spontaneous input. The homeostatic model successfully tunes network connectivity to generate robust activity patterns with appropriate timing relationships between neighboring populations. These timing relationships can be modulated by the properties of spontaneous activity, suggesting its instructive role for generating functional variability in network output. In contrast, the Hebbian model fails to produce the tight timing relationships between neighboring populations required for unidirectional activity propagation, even when additional assumptions are imposed to constrain synaptic growth. These results argue that homeostatic mechanisms are more likely than Hebbian mechanisms to tune weak connectivity based on spontaneous input in a recurrent network for rhythm generation and robust activity propagation.},

However, these models did not account for the termination of the place field shift and they were based on an abstract implementation of STDP that ignores many of the features found in cortical plasticity. Here, instead of the abstract STDP model, we use a calcium-dependent plasticity (CaDP) learning rule that can account for many of the observed properties of cortical plasticity. We use the CaDP learning rule in combination with a model of metaplasticity to simulate place field dynamics. Without any major changes to the parameters of the original model, the present simulations account both for the initial rapid place field shift and for the subsequent slowing down of this shift. These results suggest that the CaDP model captures the essence of a general cortical mechanism of synaptic plasticity, which may underlie numerous forms of synaptic plasticity observed both in vivo and in vitro.

Changes in excitatory or inhibitory synaptic weights are registered and stored in a nonvolatile and compact digital format analogous to the discrete insertion and removal of AMPA or GABA receptor channels.

	abstract = {Background: Synaptic plasticity underlies many aspect of learning memory and development. The properties of synaptic plasticity can change as a function of previous plasticity and previous activation of synapses, a phenomenon called metaplasticity. Synaptic plasticity not only changes the functional connectivity between neurons but in some cases produces a structural change in synaptic spines; a change thought to form a basis for this observed plasticity. Here we examine to what extent structural plasticity of spines can be a cause for metaplasticity. This study is motivated by the observation that structural changes in spines are likely to affect the calcium dynamics in spines. Since calcium dynamics determine the sign and magnitude of synaptic plasticity, it is likely that structural plasticity will alter the properties of synaptic plasticity. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study we address the question how spine geometry and alterations of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors conductance may affect plasticity. Based on a simplified model of the spine in combination with a calcium-dependent plasticity rule, we demonstrated that after the induction phase of plasticity a shift of the long term potentiation (LTP) or long term depression (LTD) threshold takes place. This induces a refractory period for further LTP induction and promotes depotentiation as observed experimentally. That resembles the BCM metaplasticity rule but specific for the individual synapse. In the second phase, alteration of the NMDA response may bring the synapse to a state such that further synaptic weight alterations are feasible. We show that if the enhancement of the NMDA response is proportional to the area of the post synaptic density (PSD) the plasticity curves most likely return to the initial state. Conclusions/Significance: Using simulations of calcium dynamics in synaptic spines, coupled with a biophysically motivated calcium-dependent plasticity rule, we find under what conditions structural plasticity can form the basis of synapse specific metaplasticity. © 2009 Kalantzis, Shouval.},

However, this model is not completely stable. Here, we propose a mechanism of stabilization through homeostatic regulation of intracellular calcium levels. With this model, synapses are stable and exhibit properties such as those observed in metaplasticity and synaptic scaling. In addition, the model displays synaptic competition, allowing structures to emerge in the synaptic space that reflect the statistical properties of the inputs.

	abstract = {Different mechanisms that could form the molecular basis for bi-directional synaptic plasticity have been identified experimentally and corresponding biophysical models can be constructed. However, such models are complex and therefore it is hard to deduce their consequences to compare them to existing abstract models of synaptic plasticity. In this paper we examine two such models: a phenomenological one inspired by the phenomena of AMPA receptor insertion, and a more complex biophysical model based on the phenomena of AMPA receptor phosphorylation. We show that under certain approximations both these models can be mapped on to an equivalent, calcium-dependent, differential equation. Intracellular calcium concentration varies locally in each postsynaptic compartment, thus the plasticity rule we extract is a single-synapse rule. We convert this single synapse plasticity equation to a multi-synapse rule by incorporating a model of the NMDA receptor. Finally we suggest a mathematical embodiment of metaplasticity, which is consistent with observations on NMDA receptor properties and dependence on cellular activity. These results, in combination with some of our previous results, produce converging evidence for the calcium control hypothesis including a dependence of synaptic plasticity on the level of intercellular calcium as well as on the temporal pattern of calcium transients.},

	doi = {10.3389/fncom.2010.00019},
	abstract = {Spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is a phenomenon in which the precise timing of spikes affects the sign and magnitude of changes in synaptic strength. STDP is often interpreted as the comprehensive learning rule for a synapse - the "first law" of synaptic plasticity. This interpretation is made explicit in theoretical models in which the total plasticity produced by complex spike patterns results from a superposition of the effects of all spike pairs. Although such models are appealing for their simplicity, they can fail dramatically. For example, the measured single-spike learning rule between hippocampal CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons does not predict the existence of long-term potentiation one of the best-known forms of synaptic plasticity. Layers of complexity have been added to the basic STDP model to repair predictive failures, but they have been outstripped by experimental data. We propose an alternate first law: neural activity triggers changes in key biochemical intermediates, which act as a more direct trigger of plasticity mechanisms. One particularly successful model uses intracellular calcium as the intermediate and can account for many observed properties of bidirectional plasticity. In this formulation, STDP is not itself the basis for explaining other forms of plasticity, but is instead a consequence of changes in the biochemical intermediate, calcium. Eventually a mechanism-based framework for learning rules should include other messengers, discrete change at individual synapses, spread of plasticity among neighboring synapses, and priming of hidden processes that change a synapse's susceptibility to future change. Mechanism-based models provide a rich framework for the computational representation of synaptic plasticity. © 2010 Shouval, Wang and Wittenberg.},

Recent experimental and theoretical results in entorhinal cortex have shown that single neurons can exhibit persistent activity, previously thought to be generated by a network of neurons. Motivated by these single neuron results, we propose a single spiking neuron model that can learn to compute and represent interval timing. We show that a simple model, reduced analytically to a single dynamical equation, captures the average behavior of the complete high dimensional spiking model very well. Variants of this model can be used to produce bi-stable or multi-stable persistent activity.

	abstract = {In many regions of the brain, including the mammalian cortex, the strength of synaptic transmission can be bidirectionally regulated by cortical activity (synaptic plasticity). One line of evidence indicates that long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) and long-term synaptic depression (LTD), correlate with the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of sites on the α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5- methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit protein GluR1. Bidirectional synaptic plasticity can be induced by different frequencies of presynaptic stimulation, but there is considerable evidence indicating that the key variable is calcium influx through postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Here, we present a biophysical model of bidirectional synaptic plasticity based on [Ca2+]-dependent phospho/dephosphorylation of the GluR1 subunit of the AMPA receptor. The primary assumption of the model, for which there is wide experimental support, is that the postsynaptic calcium concentration, and consequent activation of calcium-dependent protein kinases and phosphatases, is the trigger for phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at GluR1 and consequent induction of LTP/LTD. We explore several different mathematical approaches, all of them based on mass-action assumptions. First, we use a first order approach, in which transition rates are functions of an activator, in this case calcium. Second, we adopt the Michaelis-Menten approach with different assumptions about the signal transduction cascades, ranging from abstract to more detailed and biologically plausible models. Despite the different assumptions made in each model, in each case, LTD is induced by a moderate increase in postsynaptic calcium and LTP is induced by high Ca2+ concentration. ©2005 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

Could the activity-dependent synthesis of new proteins account for the persistence of L-LTP and memory? Here, we examine the proposal that a self-sustaining regulation of translation can form a bistable switch that can persistently regulate the on-site synthesis of plasticity-related proteins. We show that an αCaMKII-CPEB1 molecular pair can operate as a bistable switch. Our results imply that L-LTP should produce an increase in the total amount of αCaMKII at potentiated synapses. This study also proposes an explanation for why the application of protein synthesis and αCaMKII inhibitors at the induction and maintenance phases of L-LTP result in very different outcomes. © 2009 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

In the visual cortex conditioning with spike triplets shows that the effect of the first spike pair dominates over the second. Using a previously proposed calcium-dependent plasticity model, we show that short-term synaptic dynamics and interaction between successive back-propagating action potentials (BPAP) may jointly account for the nonlinearities observed. Paired-pulse depression and attenuation of BPAPs are incorporated into the model through the use-dependent depletion of pre- and postsynaptic resources, respectively.

The ability of synapses to change their strength, called synaptic plasticity, is critical not only for regulating the flow of information within neuronal circuits, but also for learning and memory. In homosynaptic plasticity, the strength of a synapse is changed as a consequence of activity in that synapse. In heterosynaptic plasticity, the strength of a synapse changes as a result of activity in a neuron or pathway extrinsic to that synapse. Both can occur over a wide range of temporal domains. Short-term plasticity refers to changes in synaptic strength that persist for seconds to minutes. Long-term plasticity refers to changes in synaptic strength that persist for hours, days to lifetimes. In this chapter, we consider the mechanisms that underlie short-term and long-term plasticity of chemical synapses.},

If Ca 2+ influx is undercompensated for increases in spine size, then strong synapses are stabilized and synaptic strength distributions have a single peak. In contrast, overcompensation of Ca 2+ influx leads to binary, persistent synaptic strengths with double-peaked distributions. Biophysical simulations predict that CA1 pyramidal neuron spines are undercompensating. This unifies experimental findings that weak synapses are more plastic than strong synapses, that synaptic strengths are unimodally distributed, and that potentiation saturates for a given stimulus strength.

Brief daily reactivations during rest- periods suffice to not only maintain the assemblies, but even strengthen them, and improve pattern completion, consistent with offline memory gains observed experimentally.

After random stimulation, the synaptic weights reach an equilibrium distribution which is stable, unimodal, and has positive skew. This weight distribution compares favorably to the distributions of quantal amplitudes and of receptor number observed experimentally in central neurons and contrasts to the distribution found in plasticity models without size-dependent potentiation. Also in contrast to those models, which show strong competition between the synapses, stable plasticity is achieved with little competition. Instead, competition can be introduced by including a separate mechanism that scales synaptic strengths multiplicatively as a function of postsynaptic activity. In this model, synaptic weights change in proportion to how correlated they are with other inputs onto the same postsynaptic neuron. These results indicate that stable correlation-based plasticity can be achieved without introducing competition, suggesting that plasticity and competition need not coexist in all circuits or at all developmental stages.},

Such currents have the ability to make the total conductance of the circuit negative in a timescale that is termed “slow” because it is intermediate between the fast timescale of the spike upstroke and the ultraslow timescale of even slower adaptation currents. We discuss how such currents can be assessed either in voltage-clamp experiments or in computational models. We show that, while frequent in the literature, mathematical and computational models of bursting that lack the slow negative conductance are fragile and rigid. Our results suggest that modeling the slow negative conductance of cellular models is important when studying the neuromodulation of rhythmic circuits at any broader scale. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Nervous system functions rely on the modulation of neuronal activity between different rhythmic patterns. The mechanisms of this modulation are still poorly understood. Using computational modeling, we show the critical role of currents that provide slow negative conductance, distinct from the fast negative conductance necessary for spike generation. The significance of the slow negative conductance for neuromodulation is often overlooked, leading to computational models that are rigid and fragile.},

Our paper highlights the role of a cellular switching mechanism to orchestrate such circuits. The cellular switch makes the circuits reconfigurable, robust, adaptable, and externally controllable. Without this cellular mechanism, the circuit rhythms entirely rely on specific tunings of the synaptic connectivity, which makes them rigid, fragile, and difficult to control externally. We illustrate those properties on the much studied architecture of a small network controlling both the pyloric and gastric rhythms of crabs. The cellular switch is provided by a slow negative conductance often neglected in mathematical modeling of central pattern generators.

Such an adaptation property relies heavily on cellular neuromodulation, the biological mechanism that dynamically controls intrinsic properties of neurons and their response to external stimuli in a context-dependent manner. In this paper, we take inspiration from cellular neuromodulation to construct a new deep neural network architecture that is specifically designed to learn adaptive behaviours. The network adaptation capabilities are tested on navigation benchmarks in a meta-reinforcement learning context and compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Results show that neuromodulation is capable of adapting an agent to different tasks and that neuromodulation-based approaches provide a promising way of improving adaptation of artificial systems.},

To reliably encode a wide range of signals, neurons need to achieve a broad range of firing frequencies and to move smoothly between low and high firing rates. This can be achieved with specific ionic currents, such as A-type potassium currents, which can linearize the frequency-input current curve. By applying recently developed mathematical tools to a number of biophysical neuron models, we show how currents that are classically thought to permit low firing rates can paradoxically cause a jump to a high minimum firing rate when expressed at higher levels. Consequently, achieving and maintaining a low firing rate is surprisingly difficult and fragile in a biological context. This difficulty can be overcome via interactions between multiple currents, implying a need for ion channel degeneracy in the tuning of neuronal properties.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002050},
	abstract = {Midbrain dopaminergic neurons are endowed with endogenous slow pacemaking properties. In recent years, many different groups have studied the basis for this phenomenon, often with conflicting conclusions. In particular, the role of a slowly-inactivating L-type calcium channel in the depolarizing phase between spikes is controversial, and the analysis of slow oscillatory potential (SOP) recordings during the blockade of sodium channels has led to conflicting conclusions. Based on a minimal model of a dopaminergic neuron, our analysis suggests that the same experimental protocol may lead to drastically different observations in almost identical neurons. For example, complete L-type calcium channel blockade eliminates spontaneous firing or has almost no effect in two neurons differing by less than 1\% in their maximal sodium conductance. The same prediction can be reproduced in a state of the art detailed model of a dopaminergic neuron. Some of these predictions are confirmed experimentally using single-cell recordings in brain slices. Our minimal model exhibits SOPs when sodium channels are blocked, these SOPs being uncorrelated with the spiking activity, as has been shown experimentally. We also show that block of a specific conductance (in this case, the SK conductance) can have a different effect on these two oscillatory behaviors (pacemaking and SOPs), despite the fact that they have the same initiating mechanism. These results highlight the fact that computational approaches, besides their well known confirmatory and predictive interests in neurophysiology, may also be useful to resolve apparent discrepancies between experimental results. © 2011 Drion et al.},

The results are presented in the context of half-center oscillators, which are simple rhythmic circuits composed of two reciprocally connected inhibitory neuronal populations. Specifically, we focus on rhythms that rely on a particular excitability property, the postinhibitory rebound, an intrinsic cellular property that elicits transient membrane depolarization when released from hyperpolarization. Two distinct ionic currents can evoke this transient depolarization: a hyperpolarization-activated cation current and a low-threshold T-type calcium current. The presence of a slow activation is specific to the T-type calcium current and provides a slow positive feedback at the cellular level that is absent in the cation current. We show that this slow positive feedback is required to endow the network rhythm with physiological modulation and robustness properties. This study thereby identifies an essential cellular property to be retained at the network level in modeling network robustness and modulation.},

The specific architecture of the models is key to the tractability of their analysis: in spite of their high-dimensional and nonlinear nature, the model properties can be understood in terms of few canonical positive and negative feedback motifs localized in distinct timescales.

	abstract = {Fifty years ago, FitzHugh introduced a phase portrait that became famous for a twofold reason: it captured in a physiological way the qualitative behavior of Hodgkin-Huxley model and it revealed the power of simple dynamical models to unfold complex firing patterns. To date, in spite of the enormous progresses in qualitative and quantitative neural modeling, this phase portrait has remained a core picture of neuronal excitability. Yet, a major difference between the neurophysiology of 1961 and of 2011 is the recognition of the prominent role of calcium channels in firing mechanisms. We show that including this extra current in Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics leads to a revision of FitzHugh-Nagumo phase portrait that affects in a fundamental way the reduced modeling of neural excitability. The revisited model considerably enlarges the modeling power of the original one. In particular, it captures essential electrophysiological signatures that otherwise require non-physiological alteration or considerable complexification of the classical model. As a basic illustration, the new model is shown to highlight a core dynamical mechanism by which calcium channels control the two distinct firing modes of thalamocortical neurons. © 2012 Drion et al.},

Applied to the control of beta oscillations in the basal ganglia, the model shows the modulation of beta activity under the action of a transient depolarization, for instance a dopamine signal. The model predicts, by analogy to the thalamocortical circuit, a novel gating function by which the transfer of cortical spikes through the indirect pathway is blocked under the inhibitory drive preceding movement but briefly released at the onset of movement execution.},

We found that specific patterns of [Ca2+](i) elevation selectively activate LTP or LTD. In particular, only LTP was triggered by a brief increase of [Ca2+](i) with relatively high magnitude, which mimics the [Ca2+](i) rise during electrical stimulation typically used to induce LTP.

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) begins with a decline in cognition followed by neuronal cell death and dementia. These changes have been linked to a deregulation of Ca2+ signalling caused by a progressive increase in the resting level of Ca2+, which may influence cognition by interfering with the rhythm rheostat that controls the sleep/wake cycle. The rise in resting levels of Ca2+ may not alter the processes of memory acquisition during consciousness (gamma and theta rhythms), but may duplicate some of the events that occur during the slow oscillations responsible for the twin processes of memory consolidation and memory erasure that occur during sleep. The persistent elevation in the resting level of Ca2+ induced by an accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) oligomers duplicates a similar small global elevation normally restricted to the period of slow oscillations when memories are erased during sleep. In AD, such a rapid erasure of memories soon after they are acquired during the wake period means that they are not retained for consolidation during sleep. The Aβ deregulates Ca2+ signalling through direct effects on the neurons and indirectly by inducing inflammatory responses in the microglia and astrocytes. Some of these deleterious effects of Aβ may be alleviated by vitamin D. © 2013 The Physiological Society.},

However, the calcium trace is temporally smeared which restricts the extraction of quantities of interest such as spike trains of individual neurons. To address this issue, spike reconstruction algorithms have been introduced. One limitation of such reconstructions is that the underlying models are not informed about the biophysics of spike and burst generations. Such existing prior knowledge might be useful for constraining the possible solutions of spikes. Here we describe, in a novel Bayesian approach, how principled knowledge about neuronal dynamics can be employed to infer biophysical variables and parameters from fluorescence traces. By using both synthetic and in vitro recorded fluorescence traces, we demonstrate that the new approach is able to reconstruct different repetitive spiking and/or bursting patterns with accurate single spike resolution. Furthermore, we show that the high inference precision of the new approach is preserved even if the fluorescence trace is rather noisy or if the fluorescence transients show slow rise kinetics lasting several hundred milliseconds, and inhomogeneous rise and decay times. In addition, we discuss the use of the new approach for inferring parameter changes, e.g. due to a pharmacological intervention, as well as for inferring complex characteristics of immature neuronal circuits.},

Spike activity just induced a fluorescent increase in the cell body while depolarization without spikes induced it in the axon hillock. In the cell body the slope of the fluorescent increase was almost relative to the spike frequency while the period of it almost corresponded to the firing duration. Therefore, the phase relationship of the rhythmic firing responses in plural neurons could be precisely detected. Moreover stable responses could be repeatedly obtained for a long time from small neurons unsuitable for a long time recording with microelectrodes.

	abstract = {Calcium (Ca2+) influx through NMDA receptors (NMDARs) is essential for synaptogenesis, experience-dependent synaptic remodeling and plasticity. The NMDAR-mediated rise in postsynaptic Ca2+ activates a network of kinases and phosphatases that promote persistent changes in synaptic strength, such as long-term potentiation (LTP). Here we show that the Ca 2+ permeability of neuronal NMDARs is under the control of the cyclic AMP-protein kinase A (cAMP-PKA) signaling cascade. PKA blockers reduced the relative fractional Ca2+ influx through NMDARs as determined by reversal potential shift analysis and by a combination of electrical recording and Ca2+ influx measurements in rat hippocampal neurons in culture and hippocampal slices from mice. In slices, PKA blockers markedly inhibited NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ rises in activated dendritic spines, with no significant effect on synaptic current. Consistent with this, PKA blockers depressed the early phase of NMDAR-dependent LTP at hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 (Sch-CA1) synapses. Our data link PKA-dependent synaptic plasticity to Ca2+ signaling in spines and thus provide a new mechanism whereby PKA regulates the induction of LTP. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

We find that, in CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute mouse hippocampal slices, CaV2.3 voltage-sensitive Ca channels (VSCCs) are found selectively on spines and act locally to dampen uncaging-evoked Ca transients and somatic potentials. These effects are mediated by a regulatory loop that requires opening of CaV2.3 channels, voltage-gated Na channels, small conductance Ca-activated potassium (SK) channels, and NMDA receptors. Ca influx through CaV2.3 VSCCs selectively activates SK channels, revealing the presence of functional Ca microdomains within the spine.

We determined the fraction of the current carried by calcium by simultaneously measuring membrane current using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques and intracellular Ca2+ using the fluorescent indicator Fura-2. The Fura-2 response to free Ca2+ was calibrated individually for each cell. Two different calibration methods are compared: one uses voltage-activated Ca2+ channels, and the other uses the same ligand-gated channels that are being tested but in a pure Ca2+ solution. The two methods give quantitatively different results. The method using pure Ca2+ currents through ligand-gated channels calibrates the Fura-2 signal through the same influx pathway that generates the test response, thus controlling for the distribution of channels and ensuring a similar interaction between the incoming Ca2+ and Fura-2. In a physiologic solution containing 2.5 mM Ca2+ at a holding potential of -50 mV, the percentage of inward current carried by Ca2+ through NMDA receptors in hippocampal neurons is 12.4\%. By comparison, in sympathetic neurons the percentage of current carried by Ca2+ through neuronal nAChRs is 4.7\%, and through ATP-activated purinergic receptors it is 6.5\%.

Several aspects of this hypothesis were examined at the Schaffer collateral CA1 synapse, where both long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) can be elicited and are Ca2+ dependent. Brief tetanic stimulation, which normally generated LTP, could induce LTD when Ca2+ entry via NMDA receptors was limited either by moderate concentrations of D-APV or by voltage clamping cells at negative membrane potentials. Repetitive activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in the absence of afferent stimulation could also elicit an LTD that was Ca2+ dependent and was occluded by prior generation of homosynaptic LTD using prolonged low frequency stimulation. These results provide strong evidence that the minimal requirements for inducing LTD involve simply a transient influx of Ca2+ into the postsynaptic cell, via either NMDA receptors or voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels.},

Further experiments demonstrate the existence of presynaptic NMDARs that underlie the presynaptic activity dependence. Finally, manipulating cannabinoid breakdown alters the temporal window for tLTD.

	volume = {63},
	doi = {10.1152/jn.1990.63.5.1148},
	abstract = {1. Because induction of associative long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus is thought to depend on Ca2+ influx through channels controlled by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, quantitative modeling was performed of synaptically mediated Ca2+ influx as a function of synaptic coactivation. The goal was to determine whether Ca2+ influx through NMDA-receptor channels was, by itself, sufficient to explain associative LTP, including control experiments and the temporal requirements of LTP. 2. Ca2+ influx through NMDA-receptor channels was modeled at a synapse on a dendritic spine of a reconstructed hippocampal dentate granule cell when 1-115 synapses on spines at different dendritic locations were activated eight times at frequencies of 10-800 Hz. The resulting change in [Ca2+] in the spine head was estimated from the Ca2+ influx with the use of a model of a dendritic spine that included Ca2+ buffers, pumps, and diffusion. 3. To use a compelling model of synaptic activation, we developed quantitative descriptions of the NMDA and non-NMDA receptor-mediated conductances consistent with available experimental data. The experimental data reported for NMDA and non-NMDA receptor-channel properties and data from other non-LTP experiments that separated the NMDA and non-NMDA receptor-mediated components of synaptic events proved to be limiting for particular synaptic variables. Relative to the non-NMDA glutamate-type receptors, 1) the unbinding of transmitter from NMDA receptors had to be slow, 2) the transition from the bound NMDA receptor-transmitter complex to the open channel state had to be even slower, and 3) the average number of NMDA-receptor channels at a single activated synapse on a single spine head that were open and conducting at a given moment in time had to be very small (usually {\textless}1). 4. With the use of these quantitative synaptic conductance descriptions, Ca2+ influx through NMDA-receptor channels at a synapse was computed for a variety of conditions. For a constant number of pulses, Ca2+ influx was calculated as a function of input frequency and the number of coactivated synapses. When few synapses were coactivated, Ca2+ influx was small, even for high-frequency activation. However, with larger numbers of coactivated synapses, there was a steep increase in Ca2+ influx with increasing input frequency because of the voltage-dependent nature of the NMDA receptor-mediated conductance. Nevertheless, total Ca2+ influx was never increased more than fourfold by increasing input frequency or the number of coactivated synapses. Such increases are too small to explain the selective induction of associative LTP in light of the sine qua non control experiment. 5. The three- to fourfold increases in Ca2+ influx obtained by increasing input frequency were amplified into 20- to 30-fold increases in free Ca2+ concentration in the spine head. This amplification of small changes in influx to large changes in concentration occurred because of transient saturation of the fast Ca2+ buffering systems. Varying the concentration and location of Ca2+ binding sites in the spine head provided insight into the range of Ca2+ binding site concentration values for which this amplification occurs. 6. The experimentally described temporal requirements of dentate gyrus associative potentiation studied with two stimulating electrodes, one activating a weakly excitatory input and the other activating a strongly excitatory input, were examined in the context of the present model. The temporal input patterns that produced the best potentiation of the weak input response in previous experiments were the same ones that produced the largest Ca2+ influx and the largest peak spine head values of [Ca2+] in the model. Parameter values estimated independently in the development of the quantitative synaptic conductance descriptions were critically reponsible for this correspondence; the timing results in the model depended on two slow rate constants in the activation of the NMDA receptor-mediated conductance. 7. In conclusion, the nonlinearity in Ca2+ influx through NMDA-receptor channels because of increases in input frequency and intensity, although very important, was not sufficient to explain associative LTP. However, the transient saturation of the fast Ca2+ buffering systems significantly amplified the nonlinearity in Ca2+ influx to provide a large, steep nonlinearity in the alteration of spine head Ca2+ concentration as a function of convergent coactivity. Successive calcium-triggered reactions could further amplify this nonlinearity.},

Equivalent LTD induction occurred whether the slices were maintained at room temperature or at 32°C. Lowering bath Ca2+ to 0 mM, or increasing it to 4 mM, prevented the induction of the depression. The NMDA receptor antagonist D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (50 μM) reversibly blocked the induction of homosynaptic LTD. In addition, the L- type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antagonist nimodipine (10 μM) and the R- and T-type VGCC antagonist NiCl2 (25 μM) also prevented homosynaptic LTD induction.

We find that in mice, SK channels are localized to dendritic spines, and their activity reduces the amplitude of evoked synaptic potentials in an NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent manner. Using combined two-photon laser scanning microscopy and two-photon laser uncaging of glutamate, we show that SK channels regulate NMDAR-dependent Ca2+ influx within individual spines. SK channels are tightly coupled to synaptically activated Ca2+ sources, and their activity reduces the amplitude of NMDAR-dependent Ca2+ transients. These effects are mediated by a feedback loop within the spine head; during an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), Ca2+ influx opens SK channels that provide a local shunting current to reduce the EPSP and promote rapid Mg2+ block of the NMDAR. Thus, blocking SK channels facilitates the induction of long-term potentiation by enhancing NMDAR-dependent Ca2+ signals within dendritic spines.},

We studied [Ca2+] signaling in dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons and find that spines are specialized structures with low endogenous Ca2+ buffer capacity that allows large and extremely rapid [Ca2+] changes. Under physiological conditions, Ca2+ diffusion across the spine neck is negligible, and the spine head functions as a separate compartment on long time scales, allowing localized Ca2+ buildup during trains of synaptic stimuli. Furthermore, the kinetics of Ca2+ sources governs the time course of [Ca2+] signals and may explain the selective activation of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) by NMDA-R-mediated synaptic Ca2+.},

In the hippocampus, Ca++ transient produced by glutamatergic ionotropic neurotransmission facilitates Ca++-Calmodulin-dependent kinase 2 (CaMKII) Thr286 phosphorylation and promote long-term potentiation (LTP) expression. At CA1 post-synaptic densities, Ca++ transients equally activate small conductance (SK2) channel which regulates excitability by suppressing Ca++ movement. Here, we demonstrate that upstream attenuation of GluN1 function in the hippocampus led to a decrease in Thr286 CaMKIIα phosphorylation, and increased SK2 expression. Consistent with the loss of GluN1 function, potentiation of SK channel in wild type hippocampus reduced CaMKIIα expression and abrogate synaptic localization of T286 pCaMKIIα. Our results demonstrate that positive modulation of SK channel at hippocampal synapses likely refine GluN1-linked plasticity by tuning dendritic localization of CaMKIIα.},

	abstract = {The spatial and temporal dynamics of many electrophysiological and biochemical processes in nerve cells are in turn dependent on the concentration dynamics of the second messenger calcium. We have used microfluorimetry of the calcium indicator fura-2 (Grynkiewicz et al., 1985) to measure and characterize synaptically activated calcium changes in individual CA1 pyramidal cells contained within guinea pig hippocampal slices. One component of the calcium changes was largely produced by influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs). It consisted of large transient accumulations in the proximal-apical and basal dendrites; the amplitude was smaller in the distal-apical dendrites and the soma. This spatial profile was insensitive to the method of cell activation: stimulation of inputs located at different positions on the dendritic tree as well as antidromic stimulation produced only slight modifications. This component was not blocked by the NMDA antagonist 5-amino-4-phosphonovalerate (AP5) (Collingridge et al., 1983), was greatly reduced by Cd2+, partially reduced by nifedipine, and was increased by Bay-K 8644, providing the evidence that it was largely produced by influx through VDCCs. Blocking postsynaptic Na+ channels with QX-314 greatly reduced the accumulation amplitude, and spatial differences between proximal-dendritic and distal-dendritic regions were less pronounced, suggesting that active sodium conductances contribute significantly to the spatial activation of calcium conductances. Residual spatial differences that persist in QX-314 experiments are consistent with the idea that VDCCs have decreased density on distal-apical dendrites. A second component of accumulation was induced by ionic currents through NMDA receptor channels. It was blocked by AP5, unaffected by QX-314, attenuated and slowed down by elevated calcium buffering, and spatially localized to regions receiving activated synaptic inputs. The magnitude of this component was strongly dependent on the frequency and amplitude of synaptic activation. At high frequency, it was generally very large, often saturating the fura-2 ({\textgreater}2 μM). Measurements made with the indicator furaptra also showed large localized AP5-sensitive fluorescence changes. Our results suggest that in dendritic regions near activated input fibers calcium levels may reach 2-10 μM. In general, our measurements of calcium dynamics provide an experimental basis for evaluating the spatial distribution of calcium conductances, the spatial distribution of calcium-activated electrophysiological and biochemical processes, and the spatial uniformity of calcium buffering and removal systems in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells. The time course and amplitude of Ca2+ transients we measured suggest that activation of Ca2+- dependent conductances [e.g., I(K(Ca))] will be markedly different for different cellular regions. The frequency dependence of the AP5-sensitive component is consistent with the Ca2+ induction model of long-term potentiation (LTP) and with ionic currents through the NMDA receptor channel serving to trigger LTP through accumulations of very large Ca2+ levels in the postsynaptic dendrite. When combined with recent results on the induction of LTP in the presence of AP5, our results suggest that the large AP5- sensitive Ca2+ accumulations are produced by both Ca2+ current through NMDA receptors and Ca2+ influx through VDCCs. The very large AP5- insensitive accumulations seen in dendritic regions that do not become potentiated during LTP suggest that either much higher Ca2+ levels ({\textgreater}low micromolar) are required to induce LTP, or that the spine apparatus sufficiently isolates the spine, preventing large Ca2+ accumulations in the dendrite from reaching the spine head.},

Although it is known that inhibitory synaptic strength is malleable, induction of long-term plasticity at distinct inhibitory synapses and its regulation of hippocampal network activity is not well understood. Here, we show that inhibitory synapses from parvalbumin and somatostatin expressing interneurons undergo long-term depression and potentiation respectively (PV-iLTD and SST-iLTP) during physiological activity patterns. Both forms of plasticity rely on T-type calcium channel activation to confer synapse specificity but otherwise employ distinct mechanisms. Since parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons preferentially target perisomatic and distal dendritic regions respectively of CA1 pyramidal cells, PV-iLTD and SST-iLTP coordinate a reprioritisation of excitatory inputs from entorhinal cortex and CA3. Furthermore, circuit-level modelling reveals that PV-iLTD and SST-iLTP cooperate to stabilise place cells while facilitating representation of multiple unique environments within the hippocampal network.},

To build foundation for future molecular biological and genetic studies, we studied kinetics of the glutamate receptor channel in embryonic Drosophila myotubes in culture using the patch clamp technique. There were many brief lasting channel events together with prolonged ones. Brief events were frequently observed in low concentrations whereas the frequency of prolonged events increased with agonist concentrations. Long openings ({\textgreater}5 ms) were often interrupted by brief closures, most of which tasted less than 100 μs, thus showing a bursting behavior. At all agonist concentrations, the burst duration was fitted with three exponential components (brief, intermediate and long). The mean duration of the long component increased linearly with the glutamate concentration. The mean closed time and number of brief closures per ms within tong bursts were independent of agonist concentration. The mean burst durations of the brief (30-250 μs) and intermediate component (300-1050 μs) did not change significantly with agonist concentration. The closing episodes within bursts were rare in the brief and intermediate burst components. The ratio of the fractional areas of the brief or intermediate and long burst components increased linearly with agonist concentration in the log-log plot with a slope of one. These findings suggest that the brief and intermediate components are due to singly-liganded openings and the long component is the result of doubly-liganded openings.},

	abstract = {Midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons in vivo exhibit two major firing patterns: single-spike firing and burst firing. The firing pattern expressed is dependent on both the intrinsic properties of the neurons and their excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Experimental data suggest that the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and GABAA receptors is a crucial contributor to the initiation and suppression of burst firing, respectively, and that blocking Ca2+-activated potassium SK channels can facilitate burst firing. A multi-compartmental model of a DA neuron with a branching structure was developed and calibrated based on in vitro experimental data to explore the effects of different levels of activation of NMDA and GABAA receptors as well as the modulation of the SK current on the firing activity. The simulated tonic activation of GABAA receptors was calibrated by taking into account the difference in the electrotonic properties in vivo versus in vitro. Although NMDA-evoked currents are required for burst generation in the model, currents evoked by GABAA-receptor activation can also regulate the firing pattern. For example, the model predicts that increasing the level of NMDA receptor activation can produce excessive depolarization that prevents burst firing, but a concurrent increase in the activation of GABAA receptors can restore burst firing. Another prediction of the model is that blocking the SK channel current in vivo will facilitate bursting, but not as robustly as blocking the GABAA receptors.},

	doi = {10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1749-06.2006},
	abstract = {Calcium is a second messenger, which can trigger the modification of synaptic efficacy. We investigated the question of whether a differential rise in postsynaptic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) alone is sufficient to account for the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of EPSPs in the basal dendrites of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex. Volume-averaged [Ca 2+]i transients were measured in spines of the basal dendritic arbor for spike-timing-dependent plasticity induction protocols. The rise in [Ca2+]i was uncorrelated to the direction of the change in synaptic efficacy, because several pairing protocols evoked similar spine [Ca2+]i transients but resulted in either LTP or LTD. The sequence dependence of near-coincident presynaptic and postsynaptic activity on the direction of changes in synaptic strength suggested that LTP and LTD were induced by two processes, which were controlled separately by postsynaptic [Ca2+]i levels. Activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels before metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) resulted in the phospholipase C-dependent (PLC-dependent) synthesis of endocannabinoids, which acted as a retrograde messenger to induce LTD. LTP required a large [Ca2+]i transient evoked by NMDA receptor activation. Blocking mGluRs abolished the induction of LTD and uncovered the Ca2+-dependent induction of LTP. We conclude that the volume-averaged peak elevation of [Ca2+]i in spines of layer 2/3 pyramids determines the magnitude of long-term changes in synaptic efficacy. The direction of the change is controlled, however, via a mGluR-coupled signaling cascade. mGluRs act in conjunction with PLC as sequence-sensitive coincidence detectors when postsynaptic precede presynaptic action potentials to induce LTD. Thus presumably two different Ca2+ sensors in spines control the induction of spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity. Copyright © 2006 Society for Neuroscience.},

	abstract = {Both synaptic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCCs) have been shown to be critical for nuclear calcium signals associated with transcriptional responses to bursts of synaptic input. However the direct contribution to nuclear calcium signals from calcium influx through NMDA receptors and VOCCs has been obscured by their concurrent roles in action potential generation and synaptic transmission. Here we compare calcium responses to synaptically induced bursts of action potentials with identical bursts devoid of any synaptic contribution generated using the pre-recorded burst as the voltage clamp command input to replay the burst in the presence of blockers of action potentials or ionotropic glutamate receptors. Synapse independent replays of bursts produced nuclear calcium responses with amplitudes around 70\% of their original synaptically generated signals and were abolished by the L-type VOCC blocker, verapamil. These results identify a major direct source of nuclear calcium from local L-type VOCCs whose activation is boosted by NMDA receptor dependent depolarization. The residual component of synaptically induced nuclear calcium signals which was both VOCC independent and NMDA receptor dependent showed delayed kinetics consistent with a more distal source such as synaptic NMDA receptors or internal stores. The dual requirement of NMDA receptors and L-type VOCCs for synaptic activity-induced nuclear calcium dependent transcriptional responses most likely reflects a direct somatic calcium influx from VOCCs whose activation is amplified by synaptic NMDA receptor-mediated depolarization and whose calcium signal is boosted by a delayed input from distal calcium sources mostly likely entry through NMDA receptors and release from internal stores.

	abstract = {At glutamatergic synapses, both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) can be induced at the same synaptic activation frequency. Instructive signals determine whether LTP or LTD is induced, by modulating local calcium transients. Synapses maintain the ability to potentiate or depress over a wide frequency range, but it remains unknown how calcium-controlled plasticity operates when frequency variations alone cause differences in calcium amplitudes. We addressed this problem at cerebellar parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses, which can undergo LTD or LTP in response to 1-Hz and 100-Hz stimulation. We observed that high-frequency activation elicits larger spine calcium transients than low-frequency stimulation under all stimulus conditions, but, regardless of activation frequency, climbing fiber (CF) coactivation provides an instructive signal that further enhances calcium transients and promotes LTD. At both frequencies, buffering calcium prevents LTD induction and LTP results instead, identifying the enhanced calcium signal amplitude as the critical parameter contributed by the instructive CF signal. These observations show that it is not absolute calcium amplitudes that determine whether LTD or LTP is evoked but, instead, the LTD threshold slides, thus preserving the requirement for relatively larger calcium transients for LTD than for LTP induction at any given stimulus frequency. Cerebellar LTD depends on the activation of calcium/ calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). Using genetically modified (TT305/6VA and T305D) mice, we identified α-CaMKII inhibition upon autophosphorylation at Thr305/306 as a molecular event underlying the threshold shift. This mechanism enables frequencyindependent plasticity control by the instructive CF signal based on relative, not absolute, calcium thresholds.},

In this paper, we consider the theoretical benefits of this two-step process at the single-neuron level and employ the theoretical notion of Matching between brain and environment to measure how this process increases the ability of the neuron to capture regularities in the environment and model them internally. We show that down-selection during sleep is beneficial for increasing or restoring Matching after learning, after integrating new with old memories, and after forgetting irrelevant material. By contrast, alternative schemes, such as additional potentiation in wake, potentiation in sleep, or synaptic renormalization in wake, decrease Matching. We also argue that, by selecting appropriate loops through the brain that tie feedforward synapses with feedback ones in the same dendritic domain, different subsets of neurons can learn to specialize for different contingencies and form sequences of nested perception-action loops. By potentiating such loops when interacting with the environment in wake, and depressing them when disconnected from the environment in sleep, neurons can learn to match the long-term statistical structure of the environment while avoiding spurious modes of functioning and catastrophic interference. Finally, such a two-step process has the additional benefit of desaturating the neuron's ability to learn and of maintaining cellular homeostasis. Thus, sleep-dependent synaptic renormalization offers a parsimonious account for both cellular and systems level effects of sleep on learning and memory. © 2013 Hashmi, Nere and Tononi.},

	abstract = {Effective connectivity between cortical areas decreases during slow wave sleep. This decline can be observed in the reduced interareal propagation of activity evoked either directly in cortex by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or by sensory stimulation. We present here a large-scale model of the thalamocortical system that is capable of reproducing these experimental observations. This model was constructed according to a large number of physiological and anatomical constraints and includes over 30,000 spiking neurons interconnected by more than 5 million synaptic connections and organized into three cortical areas. By simulating the different effects of arousal promoting neuromodulators, the model can produce a waking or a slow wave sleep-like mode. In this work, we also seek to explain why intercortical signal transmission decreases in slow wave sleep. The traditional explanation for reduced brain responses during this state, a thalamic gate, cannot account for the reduced propagation between cortical areas. Therefore we propose that a cortical gate is responsible for this diminished intercortical propagation. We used our model to test three candidate mechanisms that might produce a cortical gate during slow wave sleep: a propensity to enter a local down state following perturbation, which blocks the propagation of activity to other areas, increases in potassium channel conductance that reduce neuronal responsiveness, and a shift in the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition toward inhibition, which decreases network responses to perturbation. Of these mechanisms, we find that only a shift in the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition can account for the observed in vivo response to direct cortical perturbation as well as many features of spontaneous sleep.

	abstract = {The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY) proposes that sleep is an essential process needed by the brain to maintain the total amount of synaptic strength under control. SHY predicts that by the end of a waking day the synaptic connections of many neural circuits undergo a net increase in synaptic strength due to ongoing learning, which is mainly mediated by synaptic potentiation. Stronger synapses require more energy and supplies and are prone to saturation, creating the need for synaptic renormalization. Such renormalization should mainly occur during sleep, when the brain is disconnected from the environment and neural circuits can be broadly reactivated off-line to undergo a systematic but specific synaptic down-selection. In short, according to SHY sleep is the price to pay for waking plasticity, to avoid runaway potentiation, decreased signal-to-noise ratio, and impaired learning due to saturation. In this review, we briefly discuss the rationale of the hypothesis and recent supportive ultrastructural evidence obtained in our laboratory. We then examine recent studies by other groups showing the causal role of cortical slow waves and hippocampal sharp waves/ripples in sleep-dependent down-selection of neural activity and synaptic strength.

	doi = {10.1152/jn.00593.2010},
	abstract = {Recent evidence indicates that net synaptic strength in cortical and other networks increases during wakefulness and returns to a baseline level during sleep. These homeostatic changes in synaptic strength are accompanied by corresponding changes in sleep slow wave activity (SWA) and in neuronal firing rates and synchrony. Other evidence indicates that sleep is associated with an initial reactivation of learned firing patterns that decreases over time. Finally, sleep can enhance performance of learned tasks, aid memory consolidation, and desaturate the ability to learn. Using a large-scale model of the corticothalamic system equipped with a spike-timing dependent learning rule, in agreement with experimental results, we demonstrate a net increase in synaptic strength in the waking mode associated with an increase in neuronal firing rates and synchrony. In the sleep mode, net synaptic strength decreases accompanied by a decline in SWA. We show that the interplay of activity and plasticity changes implements a control loop yielding an exponential, self-limiting renormalization of synaptic strength. Moreover, when the model "learns" a sequence of activation during waking, the learned sequence is preferentially reactivated during sleep, and reactivation declines over time. Finally, sleepdependent synaptic renormalization leads to increased signal-to-noise ratios, increased resistance to interference, and desaturation of learning capabilities. Although the specific mechanisms implemented in the model cannot capture the variety and complexity of biological substrates, and will need modifications in line with future evidence, the present simulations provide a unified, parsimonious account for diverse experimental findings coming from molecular, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches.

The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY)proposes that sleep is the price the brain pays for plasticity. During a waking episode, learning statistical regularities about the current environment requires strengthening connections throughout thebrain. This increases cellular needs for energy and supplies, decreases signal-to-noise ratios, and saturates learning. During sleep, spontaneous activity renormalizes net synaptic strength and restores cellular homeostasis. Activity-dependent down-selection of synapses can also explain the benefits of sleep on memory acquisition, consolidation, and integration. This happens through the offline, comprehensive sampling of statistical regularities incorporated in neuronal circuits over a lifetime. This Perspective considers the rationale and evidence for SHY and points to open issues related to sleep and plasticity. What is the purpose of sleep?

	doi = {10.1093/sleep/zsz184},
	abstract = {In adolescent and adult brains several molecular, electrophysiological, and ultrastructural measures of synaptic strength are higher after wake than after sleep [1, 2]. These results support the proposal that a core function of sleep is to renormalize the increase in synaptic strength associated with ongoing learning during wake, to reestablish cellular homeostasis and avoid runaway potentiation, synaptic saturation, and memory interference [2, 3]. Before adolescence however, when the brain is still growing and many new synapses are forming, sleep is widely believed to promote synapse formation and growth. To assess the role of sleep on synapses early in life, we studied 2-week-old mouse pups (both sexes) whose brain is still undergoing significant developmental changes, but in which sleep and wake are easy to recognize. In two strains (CD-1, YFP-H) we found that pups spend {\textasciitilde}50\% of the day asleep and show an immediate increase in total sleep duration after a few hours of enforced wake, indicative of sleep homeostasis. In YFP-H pups we then used serial block-face electron microscopy to examine whether the axon-spine interface (ASI), an ultrastructural marker of synaptic strength, changes between wake and sleep. We found that the ASI of cortical synapses (layer 2, motor cortex) was on average 33.9\% smaller after sleep relative to after extended wake and the differences between conditions were consistent with multiplicative scaling. Thus, the need for sleep-dependent synaptic renormalization may apply also to the young, pre-weaned cerebral cortex, at least in the superficial layers of the primary motor area.},

	abstract = {When the brain goes from wakefulness to sleep, cortical neurons begin to undergo slow oscillations in their membrane potential that are synchronized by thalamocortical circuits and reflected in EEG slow waves. To provide a self-consistent account of the transition from wakefulness to sleep and of the generation of sleep slow waves, we have constructed a large-scale computer model that encompasses portions of two visual areas and associated thalamic and reticular thalamic nuclei. Thousands of model neurons, incorporating several intrinsic currents, are interconnected with millions of thalamocortical, corticothalamic, and both intra- and interareal corticocortical connections. In the waking mode, the model exhibits irregular spontaneous firing and selective responses to visual stimuli. In the sleep mode, neuromodulatory changes lead to slow oscillations that closely resemble those observed in vivo and in vitro. A systematic exploration of the effects of intrinsic currents and network parameters on the initiation, maintenance, and termination of slow oscillations shows the following. 1) An increase in potassium leak conductances is sufficient to trigger the transition from wakefulness to sleep. 2) The activation of persistent sodium currents is sufficient to initiate the up-state of the slow oscillation. 3) A combination of intrinsic and synaptic currents is sufficient to maintain the up-state. 4) Depolarization-activated potassium currents and synaptic depression terminate the up-state. 5) Corticocortical connections synchronize the slow oscillation. The model is the first to integrate intrinsic neuronal properties with detailed thalamocortical anatomy and reproduce neural activity patterns in both wakefulness and sleep, thereby providing a powerful tool to investigate the role of sleep in information transmission and plasticity.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives: Sleep slow-wave activity (SWA, electroencephalogram [EEG] power between 0.5 and 4.0 Hz) is homeostatically regulated, increasing with wakefulness and declining with sleep. Sleep SWA is thought to reflect sleep need, but the mechanisms of its homeostatic regulation remain unknown. Based on a recent hypothesis, we sought to determine whether a decrease in cortical synaptic strength can account for changes in sleep SWA. Design: A large-scale computer model of the sleeping thalamocortical system was used to reproduce in detail the cortical slow oscillations underlying EEG slow waves. Setting: N/A. Patients or Participants: N/A. Interventions: Simulated reductions in the strength of corticocortical synapses. Measurements and Results: Decreased synaptic strength led to (1) decreased single cell membrane potential oscillations and reduced network synchronization, (2) decreased rate of neural recruitment and decruitment, and (3) emergence of local clusters of synchronized activity. These changes were reflected in the local EEG as (1) decreased incidence of high-amplitude slow waves, (2) decreased wave slope, and (3) increased number of multipeak waves. Spectral analysis confirmed that these changes were associated with a decrease in SWA. Conclusions: A decrease in cortical synaptic strength is sufficient to account for changes in sleep SWA and is accompanied by characteristic changes in slow-wave parameters. Experimental results from rat cortical depth recordings and human high-density EEG show similar changes in slow-wave parameters with decreasing SWA, suggesting that the underlying mechanism may indeed be a net decrease in synaptic strength.},

This decrease was proportional to ASI size, which is indicative of scaling. Scaling was selective, sparing synapses that were large and lacked recycling endosomes. Similar scaling occurred for spine head volume, suggesting a distinction between weaker, more plastic synapses (∼80\%) and stronger, more stable synapses.

Here we studied the role of slow oscillations, 0.2–1 Hz rhythmic transitions between Up and Down states during stage 3/4 sleep, on dynamics of synaptic connectivity in the thalamocortical network model implementing spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity. We found that the spatiotemporal pattern of Up-state propagation determines the changes of synaptic strengths between neurons. Furthermore, an external input, mimicking hippocampal ripples, delivered to the cortical network results in input-specific changes of synaptic weights, which persisted after stimulation was removed. These synaptic changes promoted replay of specific firing sequences of the cortical neurons. Our study proposes a neuronal mechanism on how an interaction between hippocampal input, such as mediated by sharp wave-ripple events, cortical slow oscillations, and synaptic plasticity, may lead to consolidation of memories through preferential replay of cortical cell spike sequences during slow-wave sleep.},

We found that when closed-loop stimulation was applied during the Down states of sleep slow oscillation, particularly right before the transition from Down to Up state, it significantly affected the spatiotemporal pattern of the slow waves and maximized memory replay. In contrast, when the stimulation was presented during the Up states, it did not have a significant impact on the slow waves or memory performance after sleep. For multiple memories trained in awake, presenting stimulation cues associated with specific memory trace could selectively augment replay and enhance consolidation of that memory and interfere with consolidation of the others (particularly weak) memories. Our study proposes a synaptic-level mechanism of how memory consolidation is affected by sensory stimulation during sleep.},

Oscillations ({\textless}1 Hz) in SWS and transformation to an activated awake state were investigated with intracellular recordings in vivo and with computational models of the corticothalamic system. Occasional summation of the miniature EPSPs during the hyperpolarized (silent) phase of SWS oscillation activated the persistent sodium current and depolarized the membrane of cortical pyramidal (PY) cells sufficiently for spike generation, In the model, this triggered the active phase, which was maintained by lateral PY-PY excitation and persistent sodium current. Progressive depression of the excitatory interconnections and activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ current led to termination of the 20-25 Hz activity after 500-1000 msec. Including thalamocortical (TC) and thalamic reticular neurons in the model increased the duration of the active epochs up to 1-1.5 sec and introduced waning spindle sequences. An increase in acetylcholine activity, which is associated with activated states, was modeled by the reduction in the K+ leak current in PY and TC cells and by a decrease in intracortical PY-PY synaptic conductances. These changes eliminated the hyperpolarizing phases of network activity and transformed cortical neurons to tonic firing at 15-20 Hz. During the transition from SWS to the activated state, the input resistance of cortical neurons gradually increased and, in a fully activated state, reached the same or even higher values as during silent phases of SWS oscillations. The model describes many essential features of SWS and activated states in the thalamocortical system as well as the transition between them.},

	abstract = {The signature of slow-wave sleep in the electroencephalogram (EEG) is large-amplitude fluctuation of the field potential, which reflects synchronous alternation of activity and silence across cortical neurons. While initiation of the active cortical states during sleep slow oscillation has been intensively studied, the biological mechanisms which drive the network transition from an active state to silence remain poorly understood. In the current study, using a combination of in vivo electrophysiology and thalamocortical network simulation, we explored the impact of intrinsic and synaptic inhibition on state transition during sleep slow oscillation. We found that in normal physiological conditions, synaptic inhibition controls the duration and the synchrony of active state termination. The decline of interneuron-mediated inhibition led to asynchronous downward transition across the cortical network and broke the regular slow oscillation pattern. Furthermore, in both in vivo experiment and computational modelling, we revealed that when the level of synaptic inhibition was reduced significantly, it led to a recovery of synchronized oscillations in the form of seizure-like bursting activity. In this condition, the fast active state termination was mediated by intrinsic hyperpolarizing conductances.

	abstract = {Continual learning remains an unsolved problem in artificial neural networks. The brain has evolved mechanisms to prevent catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge during new training. Building upon data suggesting the importance of sleep in learning and memory, we tested a hypothesis that sleep protects old memories from being forgotten after new learning. In the thalamocortical model, training a new memory interfered with previously learned old memories leading to degradation and forgetting of the old memory traces. Simulating sleep after new learning reversed the damage and enhanced old and new memories. We found that when a new memory competed for previously allocated neuronal/synaptic resources, sleep replay changed the synaptic footprint of the old memory to allow overlapping neuronal populations to store multiple memories. Our study predicts that memory storage is dynamic, and sleep enables continual learning by combining consolidation of new memory traces with reconsolidation of old memory traces to minimize interference.},

	doi = {10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5088-12.2013},
	abstract = {Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and other conventional Hebbian-type plasticity rules are prone to produce runaway dynamics of synaptic weights. Once potentiated, a synapse would have higher probability to lead to spikes and thus to be further potentiated, but once depressed, a synapse would tend to be further depressed. The runaway synaptic dynamics can be prevented by precisely balancing STDP rules for potentiation and depression; however, experimental evidence shows a great variety of potentiation and depression windows and magnitudes. Here we show that modifications of synapses to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons from rat visual and auditory cortices in slices can be induced by intracellular tetanization: bursts of postsynaptic spikes without presynaptic stimulation. Induction of these heterosynaptic changes depended on the rise of intracellular calcium, and their direction and magnitude correlated with initial state of release mechanisms. We suggest that this type of plasticity serves as a mechanism that stabilizes the distribution of synaptic weights and prevents their runaway dynamics. To test this hypothesis, we develop a cortical neuron model implementing both homosynaptic (STDP) and heterosynaptic plasticity with properties matching the experimental data. We find that heterosynaptic plasticity effectively prevented runaway dynamics for the tested range of STDP and input parameters. Synaptic weights, although shifted from the original, remained normally distributed and nonsaturated. Our study presents a biophysically constrained model of how the interaction of different forms of plasticity-Hebbian and heterosynaptic-may prevent runaway synaptic dynamics and keep synaptic weights unsaturated and thus capable of further plastic changes and formation of new memories. © 2013 the authors.},

In this study, using a realistic computational model of the thalamocortical network, we tested the role of Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep in memory consolidation. We found that sleep spindles (the hallmark of N2 stage sleep) and slow oscillations (the hallmark of N3 stage sleep) both promote replay of the spike sequences learned in the awake state and replay was localized at the trained network locations. Memory performance improved after a period of NREM sleep but not after the same time period in awake. When multiple memories were trained, the local nature of the spike sequence replay during spindles allowed replay of the distinct memory traces independently, while slow oscillations promoted competition that could prevent replay of the weak memories in a presence of the stronger memory traces. This could lead to extinction of the weak memories unless when sleep spindles (N2 sleep) preceded slow oscillations (N3 sleep), as observed during the natural sleep cycle. Our study presents a mechanistic explanation for the role of sleep rhythms in memory consolidation and proposes a testable hypothesis how the natural structure of sleep stages provides an optimal environment to consolidate memories.},

Spindle density and synchronization properties are different in MEG versus EEG recordings in humans and also vary with learning performance, suggesting spindle involvement in memory consolidation. Here, using computational models, we identified network mechanisms that may explain differences in spindle properties across cortical structures. First, we report that differences in spindle occurrence between MEG and EEG data may arise from the contrasting properties of the core and matrix thalamocortical systems. The matrix system, projecting superficially, has wider thalamocortical fanout compared to the core system, which projects to middle layers, and requires the recruitment of a larger population of neurons to initiate a spindle. This property was sufficient to explain lower spindle density and higher spatial synchrony of spindles in the superficial cortical layers, as observed in the EEG signal. In contrast, spindles in the core system occurred more frequently but less synchronously, as observed in the MEG recordings. Furthermore, consistent with human recordings, in the model, spindles occurred independently in the core system but the matrix system spindles commonly co-occurred with core spindles. We also found that the intracortical excitatory connections from layer III/IV to layer V promote spindle propagation from the core to the matrix system, leading to widespread spindle activity. Our study predicts that plasticity of intra- and inter-cortical connectivity can potentially be a mechanism for increased spindle density as has been observed during learning.},

While this conceptual schema is well established, specific intrinsic and network-level mechanisms driving spatio-temporal patterns of hippocampal activity during sleep, and specifically controlling off-line memory reactivation are unknown. In this study, we discuss a model of hippocampal CA1-CA3 network generating spontaneous characteristic SWR activity. Our study predicts the properties of CA3 input which are necessary for successful CA1 ripple generation and the role of synaptic interactions and intrinsic excitability in spike sequence replay during SWRs. Specifically, we found that excitatory synaptic connections promote reactivation in both CA3 and CA1, but the different dynamics of sharp waves in CA3 and ripples in CA1 result in a differential role for synaptic inhibition in modulating replay: promoting spike sequence specificity in CA3 but not in CA1 areas. Finally, we describe how awake learning of spatial trajectories leads to synaptic changes sufficient to drive hippocampal cells’ reactivation during sleep, as required for sleep-related memory consolidation.},

	abstract = {Homosynaptic Hebbian-type plasticity provides a cellular mechanism of learning and refinement of connectivity during development in a variety of biological systems. In this review we argue that a complimentary form of plasticity—heterosynaptic plasticity—represents a necessary cellular component for homeostatic regulation of synaptic weights and neuronal activity. The required properties of a homeostatic mechanism which acutely constrains the runaway dynamics imposed by Hebbian associative plasticity have been well-articulated by theoretical and modeling studies. Such mechanism(s) should robustly support the stability of operation of neuronal networks and synaptic competition, include changes at non-active synapses, and operate on a similar time scale to Hebbian-type plasticity. The experimentally observed properties of heterosynaptic plasticity have introduced it as a strong candidate to fulfill this homeostatic role. Subsequent modeling studies which incorporate heterosynaptic plasticity into model neurons with Hebbian synapses (utilizing an STDP learning rule) have confirmed its ability to robustly provide stability and competition. In contrast, properties of homeostatic synaptic scaling, which is triggered by extreme and long lasting (hours and days) changes of neuronal activity, do not fit two crucial requirements for a hypothetical homeostatic mechanism needed to provide stability of operation in the face of on-going synaptic changes driven by Hebbian-type learning rules. Both the trigger and the time scale of homeostatic synaptic scaling are fundamentally different from those of the Hebbian-type plasticity. We conclude that heterosynaptic plasticity, which is triggered by the same episodes of strong postsynaptic activity and operates on the same time scale as Hebbian-type associative plasticity, is ideally suited to serve a homeostatic role during on-going synaptic plasticity.},

This supralinear summation was also noticed at gamma band stimulus frequency (≈40 Hz).

But also it functions critically in all mental operations, including attention, memory, and consciousness, likely in different ways for different processes, as indicated by the consequences of damage to its various nuclei as well as by invasive studies in nonhuman animals. It plays a critical role also in the arousal system of the brain, in emotion, in movement, and in coordinating cortical computations.

This article focuses on two topics: (i) the role of thalamic reticular neurons in the initiation of spindles, a hallmark oscillation during early sleep stages; and (ii) the reticular-induced inhibition of thalamocortical neurons during cortically generated spike-wave seizures. Although hotly debated during the past decade, the idea of spindle generation by a network of GABAergic reticular neurons was recently supported by in vivo and in computo studies demonstrating interactions between inhibitory reticular neurons that lead to spindle sequences. During spike-wave seizures and electrical paroxysms of the Lennox-Gastaut type, which arise in the neocortex, reticular neurons are powerfully excited through corticofugal projections and they produce prolonged inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in thalamocortical neurons. Thus, GABAergic reticular neurons are crucial in the generation of some sleep rhythms, which produce synaptic plasticity, and in inhibiting external signals through thalamocortical neurons, which leads to unconsciousness during absence epilepsy. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The thalamus has long been seen as responsible for relaying information on the way to the cerebral cortex, but it has not been until the last decade or so that the functional nature of this relay has attracted significant attention. Whereas earlier views tended to relegate thalamic function to a simple, machine-like relay process, recent research, reviewed in this article, demonstrates complicated circuitry and a rich array of membrane properties underlying the thalamic relay. It is now clear that the thalamic relay does not have merely a trivial function. Suggestions that the thalamic circuits and cell properties only come into play during certain phases of sleep to effectively disconnect the relay are correct as far as they go, but they are incomplete, because they fail to take into account interesting and variable properties of the relay that, we argue, occur during normal waking behavior. Although the specific function of the circuits and cellular properties of the thalamic relay for waking behavior is far from clear, we offer two related hypotheses based on recent experimental evidence. One is that the thalamus is not used just to relay peripheral information from, for example, visual, auditory, or cerebellar inputs, but that some thalamic nuclei are arranged instead to relay information from one cortical area to another. The second is that the thalamus is not a simple, passive relay of information to cortex but instead is involved in many dynamic processes that significantly alter the nature of the information relayed to cortex.},

While several brainstem structures for controlling global sleep states have now been well characterized, a mechanism underlying fast and local modulation of cortical slow waves has not been identified. Here, using optogenetics and whole cortex electrophysiology, we show that local tonic activation of thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) rapidly induces slow wave activity in a spatially restricted region of cortex. These slow waves resemble those seen in sleep, as cortical units undergo periods of silence phase-locked to the slow wave. Furthermore, animals exhibit behavioural changes consistent with a decrease in arousal state during TRN stimulation. We conclude that TRN can induce rapid modulation of local cortical state.},

Although they represent a minority of the total neocortical neuronal population, GABAergic interneurons are highly heterogeneous, forming functional classes based on their morphological, electrophysiological, and molecular features, as well as connectivity and in vivo patterns of activity. Here we review our current understanding of neocortical interneuron diversity and the properties that distinguish cell types. We then discuss how the involvement of multiple cell types, each with a specific set of cellular properties, plays a crucial role in diversifying and increasing the computational power of a relatively small number of simple circuit motifs forming cortical networks.

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030156},
	abstract = {Cortical fast-spiking (FS) interneurons display highly variable electrophysiological properties. Their spike responses to step currents occur almost immediately following the step onset or after a substantial delay, during which subthreshold oscillations are frequently observed. Their firing patterns include high-frequency tonic firing and rhythmic or irregular bursting (stuttering). What is the origin of this variability? In the present paper, we hypothesize that it emerges naturally if one assumes a continuous distribution of properties in a small set of active channels. To test this hypothesis, we construct a minimal, single-compartment conductance-based model of FS cells that includes transient Na+, delayed-rectifier K+, and slowly inactivating d-type K+ conductances. The model is analyzed using nonlinear dynamical system theory. For small Na+ window current, the neuron exhibits high-frequency tonic firing. At current threshold, the spike response is almost instantaneous for small d-current conductance, gd, and it is delayed for larger gd. As gd further increases, the neuron stutters. Noise substantially reduces the delay duration and induces subthreshold oscillations. In contrast, when the Na+ window current is large, the neuron always fires tonically. Near threshold, the firing rates are low, and the delay to firing is only weakly sensitive to noise; subthreshold oscillations are not observed. We propose that the variability in the response of cortical FS neurons is a consequence of heterogeneities in their g d and in the strength of their Na+ window current. We predict the existence of two types of firing patterns in FS neurons, differing in the sensitivity of the delay duration to noise, in the minimal firing rate of the tonic discharge, and in the existence of subthreshold oscillations. We report experimental results from intracellular recordings supporting this prediction. © 2007 Golomb et al.},

	abstract = {We used whole-cell patch recording to study 102 local interneurons in the rat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in vitro. Input impedance with this technique (607.0 ± 222.4 MΩ) was far larger than that measured with sharp electrode techniques, suggesting that interneurons may be more electrotonically compact than previously believed. Consistent and robust burst firing was observed in all interneurons when a slight depolarizing boost was given from a potential at, or slightly hyperpolarized from, resting membrane potential. These bursts had some similarities to the low-threshold spike described previously in other thalamic neuron types. The bursting responses were blocked by Ni+, suggesting that the low-threshold calcium current I(T), responsible for the low-threshold spike, was also involved in interneuron burst firing. Compared to the low-threshold spike of thalamocortical cells, however, the interneuron bursts were of relatively long duration and low intraburst frequency. The requirement for a depolarizing boost to elicit the burst is consistent with previous reports of a depolarizing shift of the I(T) activation curve of interneurons relative to thalamocortical cells, a finding we confirmed using voltage-clamp. Voltage- clamp study also revealed an additional long-lasting current that could be tentatively identified as the calcium activated non-selective cation current, I(CAN), based on reversal potential and on pharmacological characteristics. Computer simulation of the interneuron burst demonstrated that its particular morphology is likely due to the interaction of I(T) and I(CAN). In the slice, bursts could also be elicited by stimulation of the optic tract, suggesting that they may occur in response to natural stimulation. Synaptically triggered bursts were only partially blocked by Ni+, but could then be completely blocked by further addition of (±)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid. The existence of robust bursts in this cell type suggests an additional role for interneurons in sculpting sensory responses by feedforward inhibition of thalamocortical cells. The low-threshold spike is a mechanism whereby activity in a neuron is dependent on a prior lack of activity in that same neuron. Understanding of the low-threshold spike in the other major neuron types of the thalamus has brought many new insights into how thalamic oscillations might be involved in sleep and epilepsy. Our description of this phenomenon in the interneurons of the thalamus suggests that these network oscillations might be even more complicated than previously believed.},

Increasing the fanout of thalamocortical connectivity in the matrix pathway while keeping the core pathway fixed led to increased synchrony of the spindle activity in the superficial cortical layers in the model. In agreement with cortical recordings, the latency for spindles to spread from the core to the matrix was independent of the thalamocortical fanout but highly dependent on the probability of connections between cortical areas. © 2012 the authors.},

	doi = {10.3389/fncom.2013.00094},
	abstract = {A number of studies showed that deep brain stimulation (DBS) can modulate the activity in the epileptic brain and that a decrease of seizures can be achieved in 'responding' patients. In most of these studies, the choice of stimulation parameters is critical to obtain desired clinical effects. In particular, the stimulation frequency is a key parameter that is difficult to tune. A reason is that our knowledge about the frequency-dependant mechanisms according to which DBS indirectly impacts the dynamics of pathological neuronal systems located in the neocortex is still limited. We address this issue using both computational modeling and intracerebral EEG (iEEG) data. We developed a macroscopic (neural mass) model of the thalamocortical network. In line with already-existing models, it includes interconnected neocortical pyramidal cells and interneurons, thalamocortical cells and reticular neurons. The novelty was to introduce, in the thalamic compartment, the biophysical effects of direct stimulation. Regarding clinical data, we used a quite unique data set recorded in a patient (drug-resistant epilepsy) with a focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). In this patient, DBS strongly reduced the sustained epileptic activity of the FCD for low-frequency (LFS, {\textless} 2 Hz) and high-frequency stimulation (HFS, {\textgreater} 70 Hz) while intermediate-frequency stimulation (IFS, around 50 Hz) had no effect. Signal processing, clustering and optimization techniques allowed us to identify the necessary conditions for reproducing, in the model, the observed frequency-dependent stimulation effects. Key elements which explain the suppression of epileptic activity in the FCD include a) feed-forward inhibition and synaptic short-term depression of thalamocortical connections at LFS, and b) inhibition of the thalamic output at HFS. Conversely, modeling results indicate that IFS favors thalamic oscillations and entrains epileptic dynamics. © 2013 Mina, Benquet, Pasnicu, Biraben and Wendling.},

	abstract = {Thalamocortical neurons relay sensory and motor information to the neocortex using both single spikes and bursts; bursts prevail during low-vigilance states but also occur during awake behavior. Bursts are suggested to provide an alerting signal to the cortex and enhance stimulus detection, but the synaptic mechanisms underlying these effects are not clear, because the postsynaptic responses of different subtypes of cortical neurons to unitary thalamocortical bursts are mostly unknown. Using optogenetically guided recordings in mouse thalamocortical slices,weachieved the first reported paired intracellular recordings from nine monosynaptically connected thalamic and cortical neurons, including principal cells and two subtypes of inhibitory interneurons, and compared between cortical responses to single thalamocortical spikes and bursts. In 18 additional cortical neurons, we elicited unitary burst responses optogenetically. Shortterm dynamics and temporal summation of burst-evoked EPSPs were cell-type dependent: in principal cells and somatostatin-containing (SOM), but not fast-spiking (FS), interneurons, peak response during a burst was on average more than twofold larger than the response to the first spike. Thus, firing a burst instead of a single spike would more than double the probability of firing in postsynaptic excitatory neurons and inSOM,but not FS, interneurons. Consistent with this prediction, FS interneurons held near firing threshold fired most often on the first burst component, whereas SOM interneurons fired only on the second or later components. By increasing excitation of principal cells together with SOM-mediated, distally directed inhibition, thalamocortical bursts could momentarily enhance the saliency of the ascending sensory stimulus over less urgent, top-down inputs.},

The resulting BTDP exhibits exponential decays with the same time scales as those of STDP. In weakly coupled bursting neuron networks, the synaptic modification driven by the spike-burst activity obeys a power-law distribution.

In modeling studies, we find that this form of synaptic modification can automatically balance synaptic strengths to make postsynaptic firing irregular but more sensitive to presynaptic spike timing. It has been argued that neurons in vivo operate in such a balanced regime. Synapses modifiable by STDP compete for control of the timing of postsynaptic action potentials. Inputs that fire the postsynaptic neuron with short latency or that act in correlated groups are able to compete most successfully and develop strong synapses, while synapses of longer-latency or less-effective inputs are weakened.},

	abstract = {Cerebellar Purkinje cells mediate accurate eye movement coordination. However, it remains unclear how oculomotor adaptation depends on the interplay between the characteristic Purkinje cell response patterns, namely tonic, bursting, and spike pauses. Here, a spiking cerebellar model assesses the role of Purkinje cell firing patterns in vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) adaptation. The model captures the cerebellar microcircuit properties and it incorporates spike-based synaptic plasticity at multiple cerebellar sites. A detailed Purkinje cell model reproduces the three spike-firing patterns that are shown to regulate the cerebellar output. Our results suggest that pauses following Purkinje complex spikes (bursts) encode transient disinhibition of target medial vestibular nuclei, critically gating the vestibular signals conveyed by mossy fibres. This gating mechanism accounts for early and coarse VOR acquisition, prior to the late reflex consolidation. In addition, properly timed and sized Purkinje cell bursts allow the ratio between long-term depression and potentiation (LTD/LTP) to be finely shaped at mossy fibre-medial vestibular nuclei synapses, which optimises VOR consolidation. Tonic Purkinje cell firing maintains the consolidated VOR through time. Importantly, pauses are crucial to facilitate VOR phase-reversal learning, by reshaping previously learnt synaptic weight distributions. Altogether, these results predict that Purkinje spike burst-pause dynamics are instrumental to VOR learning and reversal adaptation.},

This selforganization process simulates three development phases: an early experience-independent phase, a late experience-independent phase and a subsequent refinement phase during which experience acts to shape the map properties. The ocular dominance maps that emerge accommodate the two sets of monocular inputs that arise from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to layer 4 of V1. The orientation selectivity maps that emerge feature well-developed isoorientation domains and fractures. During the last two phases of development the orientation preferences at some locations appear to rotate continuously through +/- 180° along circular paths and referred to as pinwheel-like patterns but without any corresponding point discontinuities in the orientation gradient maps. The formation of these functional maps is driven by balanced excitatory and inhibitory currents that are established via synaptic plasticity based on spike timing for both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The stability and maintenance of the formed maps with continuous synaptic plasticity is enabled by homeostasis caused by inhibitory plasticity. However, a prolonged exposure to repeated stimuli does alter the formed maps over time due to plasticity. The results from this study suggest that continuous synaptic plasticity in both excitatory neurons and interneurons could play a critical role in the formation, stability, and maintenance of functional maps in the cortex. © 2013 Srinivasa and Jiang.},

To explain these connectivity patterns, we created a model of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in which synaptic changes depend on presynaptic spike arrival and the postsynaptic membrane potential, filtered with two different time constants. Our model describes several nonlinear effects that are observed in STDP experiments, as well as the voltage dependence of plasticity. We found that, in a simulated recurrent network of spiking neurons, our plasticity rule led not only to development of localized receptive fields but also to connectivity patterns that reflect the neural code. For temporal coding procedures with spatio-temporal input correlations, strong connections were predominantly unidirectional, whereas they were bidirectional under rate-coded input with spatial correlations only. Thus, variable connectivity patterns in the brain could reflect different coding principles across brain areas; moreover, our simulations suggested that plasticity is fast. © 2010 Nature America, Inc.

	abstract = {According to spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), the timing of the Na + spike relative to the EPSP determines whether LTP or LTD will occur. Here, we review our reservations about STDP. Most investigations of this process have been done under conditions in which the spike is evoked by postsynaptic current injection. Under more realistic conditions, in which the spike is evoked by the EPSP, the results do not generally support STDP. For instance, low-frequency stimulation of a group of synapses can cause LTD, not the LTP predicted by the pre-before-post sequence in STDP; this is true regardless of whether or not the EPSP is large enough to produce a Na + spike. With stronger or more frequent stimulation, LTP can be induced by the same pre-before-post timing, but in this case block of Na + spikes does not necessarily prevent LTP induction. Thus, Na + spikes may facilitate LTP and/or LTD under some conditions, but they are not necessary, a finding consistent with their small size relative to the EPSP in many parts of pyramidal cell dendrites. The nature of the dendritic depolarizing events that control bidirectional plasticity is of central importance to understanding neural function. There are several candidates, including backpropagating action potentials, but also dendritic Ca 2+ spikes, the AMPA receptor-mediated EPSP, and NMDA receptor-mediated EPSPs or spikes. These often appear to be more important than the Na + spike in providing the depolarization necessary for plasticity. We thus feel that it is premature to accept STDP-like processes as the major determinant of LTP/LTD. © 2010 Lisman and Spruston.},

Unfortunately, those paired-based STDP models cannot account for the dependence on the repetition frequency of the pairs of spike. Moreover, those STDP models cannot reproduce recent triplet and quadruplet experiments. Here, we examine a triplet rule (i.e., a rule which considers sets of three spikes, i.e., two pre and one post or one pre and two post) and compare it to classical pair-based STDP learning rules. With such a triplet rule, it is possible to fit experimental data from visual cortical slices as well as from hippocampal cultures.

	abstract = {Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is a widespread plasticity mechanism in the nervous system. The simplest description of STDP only takes into account pairs of pre- and postsynaptic spikes, with potentiation of the synapse when a presynaptic spike precedes a postsynaptic spike and depression otherwise. In light of experiments that explored a variety of spike patterns, the pair-based STDP model has been augmented to account for multiple pre- and postsynaptic spike interactions. As a result, a number of different “multi-spike” STDP models have been proposed based on different experimental observations. The behavior of these models at the population level is crucial for understanding mechanisms of learning and memory. The challenging balance between the stability of a population of synapses and their competitive modification is well studied for pair-based models, but it has not yet been fully analyzed for multi-spike models. Here, we address this issue through numerical simulations of an integrate-and-fire model neuron with excitatory synapses subject to STDP described by three different proposed multi-spike models. We also analytically calculate average synaptic changes and fluctuations about these averages. Our results indicate that the different multi-spike models behave quite differently at the population level. Although each model can produce synaptic competition in certain parameter regions, none of them induces synaptic competition with its originally fitted parameters. The dichotomy between synaptic stability and Hebbian competition, which is well characterized for pair-based STDP models, persists in multi-spike models. However, anti-Hebbian competition can coexist with synaptic stability in some models. We propose that the collective behavior of synaptic plasticity models at the population level should be used as an additional guideline in applying phenomenological models based on observations of single synapses.},

The aim of the document is to provide a framework for classifying and evaluating different models of plasticity. We focus on phenomenological synaptic models that are compatible with integrate-and-fire type neuron models where each neuron is described by a small number of variables. This implies that synaptic update rules for short-term or long-term plasticity can only depend on spike timing and, potentially, on membrane potential, as well as on the value of the synaptic weight, or on low-pass filtered (temporally averaged) versions of the above variables. We examine the ability of the models to account for experimental data and to fulfill expectations derived from theoretical considerations. We further discuss their relations to teacher-based rules (supervised learning) and reward-based rules (reinforcement learning).

	abstract = {Long-term synaptic modification depends on the relative timing of individual pre- and postsynaptic spikes, but the rules governing the effects of multispike bursts remain to be fully understood. In particular, some studies suggest that the spike timing dependence of synaptic modification breaks down with high-frequency bursts. In this study, we characterized the effects of pre- and postsynaptic bursts on long-term modification of layer 2/3 synapses in visual cortical slices from young rats. We found that, while pairing-induced synaptic modification depends on the burst frequency, this dependence can be explained in terms of the timing of individual pre- and postsynaptic spikes. Later spikes in each burst are less effective in synaptic modification, but spike efficacy is regulated differently in pre- and postsynaptic bursts. Presynaptically, spike efficacy is progressively weakened, in parallel with short-term synaptic depression. Postsynaptically, spike efficacy is suppressed to a lesser extent, and it depends on postsynaptic potassium channel activation. Such timing-dependent interaction among multiple spikes can account for synaptic modifications induced by a variety of spike trains, including the frequency-dependent transition from depression to potentiation induced by a postsynaptic burst preceding a presynaptic burst.

	abstract = {In this paper, the generation of multi-clustered structure of self-organized neural network with different neuronal firing patterns, i.e., bursting or spiking, has been investigated. The initially all-to-all-connected spiking neural network or bursting neural network can be self-organized into clustered structure through the symmetric spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning for both bursting and spiking neurons. However, the time consumption of this clustering procedure of the burst-based self-organized neural network (BSON) is much shorter than the spike-based self-organized neural network (SSON). Our results show that the BSON network has more obvious small-world properties, i.e., higher clustering coefficient and smaller shortest path length than the SSON network. Also, the results of larger structure entropy and activity entropy of the BSON network demonstrate that this network has higher topological complexity and dynamical diversity, which benefits for enhancing information transmission of neural circuits. Hence, we conclude that the burst firing can significantly enhance the efficiency of clustering procedure and the emergent clustered structure renders the whole network more synchronous and therefore more sensitive to weak input. This result is further confirmed from its improved performance on stochastic resonance. Therefore, we believe that the multi-clustered neural network which self-organized from the bursting dynamics has high efficiency in information processing.},

Here, we propose a four-pathway plasticity framework that is well grounded in experimental evidence and apply it to a biophysically realistic cortical pyramidal neuron model. We show in computer simulations that several seemingly contradictory experimental landmark studies are consistent with one unifying set of mechanisms when considering the effects of signal propagation in dendritic trees with respect to synapse location. Our model identifies specific spatiotemporal contributions of dendritic and axo-somatic spikes as well as of subthreshold activation of synaptic clusters, providing a unified parsimonious explanation not only for rate and timing dependence but also for location dependence of synaptic changes.},

Based on incorporation of radioactively labeled N-ethylmaleimide, the readily reactive thiol groups of isolated myosin (EC 3.6.1.3) from fast, slow and cardiac muscles could be classified into 3 types. All 3 myosins contain 2 thiol-1, 2 thiol-2 and a variable number of thiol-3 groups per molecule. Both thiol-1 and thiol-2 groups which are essential for functioning of the K+-stimulated ATPase, are located in the heavy chains in all 3 myosin types. 2. The variation in the incorporation pattern of N-ethylmaleimide over the 3 thiol group classes under steady-state conditions of Mg(2+) - ATP hydrolysis allowed different conformations of some reaction intermediates to be characterized. In all 3 types of myosin the hydrolytic cycle of Mg(2+) - ATP was found to be controlled by the same step at 25 degrees C. In all three cases, this rate-limiting step is changed in the same way by lowereing temperature. 3. Using the chemically determined molecular weights for myosin light chains, their stoichiometry was found on the basis of sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis to be 1.2 : 2.1 : 0.8 for light chain-1: light chain-2:light chain-3 per molecule of fast myosin, 2.0 : 1.9 for light chain-1:light chain-2 per molecule of slow myosin and 1.9 : 1.9 for light chain-1:light chain-2 per molecule of cardiac myosin. This qualitative difference in light subunit composition between the fast and the two types of slow myosin is not reflected in the small variations of the characteristics exhibited by the isolated myosins, but rather seems to be connected with their respective myofibrillar ATPase activities.},

	abstract = {We present a model of spike-driven synaptic plasticity inspired by experimental observations and motivated by the desire to build an electronic hardware device that can learn to classify complex stimuli in a semisupervised fashion. During training, patterns of activity are sequentially imposed on the input neurons, and an additional instructor signal drives the output neurons toward the desired activity. The network is made of integrate-and-fire neurons with constant leak and a floor. The synapses are bistable, and they are modified by the arrival of presynaptic spikes. The sign of the change is determined by both the depolarization and the state of a variable that integrates the postsynaptic action potentials. Following the training phase, the instructor signal is removed, and the output neurons are driven purely by the activity of the input neurons weighted by the plastic synapses. In the absence of stimulation, the synapses preserve their internal state indefinitely. Memories are also very robust to the disruptive action of spontaneous activity. A network of 2000 input neurons is shown to be able to classify correctly a large number (thousands) of highly overlapping patterns (300 classes of preprocessed Latex characters, 30 patterns per class, and a subset of the NIST characters data set) and to generalize with performances that are better than or comparable to those of artificial neural networks. Finally we show that the synaptic dynamics is compatible with many of the experimental observations on the induction of long-term modifications (spike-timing-dependent plasticity and its dependence on both the postsynaptic depolarization and the frequency of pre- and postsynaptic neurons).},

	abstract = {Despite the ubiquity of sleep across phylogeny, its function remains elusive. In this review, we consider one compelling candidate: brain plasticity associated with memory processing. Focusing largely on hippocampus-dependent memory in rodents and humans, we describe molecular, cellular, network, whole-brain and behavioral evidence establishing a role for sleep both in preparation for initial memory encoding, and in the subsequent offline consolidation of memory. Sleep and sleep deprivation bidirectionally alter molecular signaling pathways that regulate synaptic strength and control plasticity-related gene transcription and protein translation. At the cellular level, sleep deprivation impairs cellular excitability necessary for inducing synaptic potentiation and accelerates the decay of long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity. In contrast, rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep enhance previously induced synaptic potentiation, although synaptic de-potentiation during sleep has also been observed. Beyond single cell dynamics, large-scale cell ensembles express coordinated replay of prior learning-related firing patterns during subsequent NREM sleep. At the whole-brain level, somewhat analogous learning-Associated hippocampal (re)activation during NREM sleep has been reported in humans. Moreover, the same cortical NREM oscillations associated with replay in rodents also promote human hippocampal memory consolidation, and this process can be manipulated using exogenous reactivation cues during sleep. Mirroring molecular findings in rodents, specific NREM sleep oscillations before encoding refresh human hippocampal learning capacity, while deprivation of sleep conversely impairs subsequent hippocampal activity and associated encoding. Together, these cross-descriptive level findings demonstrate that the unique neurobiology of sleep exerts powerful effects on molecular, cellular and network mechanisms of plasticity that govern both initial learning and subsequent long-term memory consolidation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

We investigated the cellular events involved in this process during ocular dominance plasticity (ODP)-a canonical form of in vivo cortical plasticity triggered by monocular deprivation (MD) and consolidated by sleep via undetermined, activity-dependent mechanisms. We find that sleep consolidates ODP primarily by strengthening cortical responses to nondeprived eye stimulation. Consolidation is inhibited by reversible, intracortical antagonism of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) or cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) during post-MD sleep. Consolidation is also associated with sleep-dependent increases in the activity of remodeling neurons and in the phosphorylation of proteins required for potentiation of glutamatergic synapses. These findings demonstrate that synaptic strengthening via NMDAR and PKA activity is a key step in sleep-dependent consolidation of ODP. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004241},
	abstract = {Sleep is critical for hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation. However, the underlying mechanisms of synaptic plasticity are poorly understood. The central controversy is on whether long-term potentiation (LTP) takes a role during sleep and which would be its specific effect on memory. To address this question, we used immunohistochemistry to measure phosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (pCaMKIIα) in the rat hippocampus immediately after specific sleep-wake states were interrupted. Control animals not exposed to novel objects during waking (WK) showed stable pCaMKIIα levels across the sleep-wake cycle, but animals exposed to novel objects showed a decrease during subsequent slow-wave sleep (SWS) followed by a rebound during rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM). The levels of pCaMKIIα during REM were proportional to cortical spindles near SWS/REM transitions. Based on these results, we modeled sleep-dependent LTP on a network of fully connected excitatory neurons fed with spikes recorded from the rat hippocampus across WK, SWS and REM. Sleep without LTP orderly rescaled synaptic weights to a narrow range of intermediate values. In contrast, LTP triggered near the SWS/REM transition led to marked swaps in synaptic weight ranking. To better understand the interaction between rescaling and restructuring during sleep, we implemented synaptic homeostasis and embossing in a detailed hippocampal-cortical model with both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Synaptic homeostasis was implemented by weakening potentiation and strengthening depression, while synaptic embossing was simulated by evoking LTP on selected synapses. We observed that synaptic homeostasis facilitates controlled synaptic restructuring. The results imply a mechanism for a cognitive synergy between SWS and REM, and suggest that LTP at the SWS/REM transition critically influences the effect of sleep: Its lack determines synaptic homeostasis, its presence causes synaptic restructuring.},

	abstract = {In the awake brain, information about the external world reaches the hippocampus via the entorhinal cortex, whereas during sleep the direction of information flow is reversed: population bursts initiated in the hippocampus invade the neocortex. We suggest that neocortico-hippocampal transfer of information and the modification process in neocortical circuitries by the hippocampal output take place in a temporally discontinuous manner associated with theta/gamma oscillations. On the other hand, transfer of the stored representations to neocortical areas is carried by discrete quanta of cooperative neuronal bursts (called sharp wave bursts) initiated in the hippocampus during slow wave sleep. The spatio-temporal participation of principal cells in sharp waves is determined by experience-induced changes in the CA3 recurrent collateral matrix. The co-operative, converging pre-synaptic activity can induce localized fast spikes and associated calcium influx in the apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells, a necessary condition for the induction of synaptic plasticity. In addition, the subcortical effects of hippocampal sharp wave bursts may be critical in the release of various hormones which, in turn, may affect synaptic plasticity. These observations suggest that sleep patterns in the limbic system are essential for the preservation of experience-induced synaptic modifications.},

Sleep is known to be beneficial to cognitive and mnemonic tasks, while chronic sleep deprivation is detrimental. Despite the importance of the phenomenon, a complete understanding of its functions and underlying mechanisms is still lacking. In this paper, we show interesting effects of deep-sleep-like slow oscillation activity on a simplified thalamo-cortical model which is trained to encode, retrieve and classify images of handwritten digits. During slow oscillations, spike-timing-dependent-plasticity (STDP) produces a differential homeostatic process. It is characterized by both a specific unsupervised enhancement of connections among groups of neurons associated to instances of the same class (digit) and a simultaneous down-regulation of stronger synapses created by the training. This hierarchical organization of post-sleep internal representations favours higher performances in retrieval and classification tasks. The mechanism is based on the interaction between top-down cortico-thalamic predictions and bottom-up thalamo-cortical projections during deep-sleep-like slow oscillations. Indeed, when learned patterns are replayed during sleep, cortico-thalamo-cortical connections favour the activation of other neurons coding for similar thalamic inputs, promoting their association. Such mechanism hints at possible applications to artificial learning systems.},

	doi = {10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5088-12.2013},
	abstract = {Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and other conventional Hebbian-type plasticity rules are prone to produce runaway dynamics of synaptic weights. Once potentiated, a synapse would have higher probability to lead to spikes and thus to be further potentiated, but once depressed, a synapse would tend to be further depressed. The runaway synaptic dynamics can be prevented by precisely balancing STDP rules for potentiation and depression; however, experimental evidence shows a great variety of potentiation and depression windows and magnitudes. Here we show that modifications of synapses to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons from rat visual and auditory cortices in slices can be induced by intracellular tetanization: bursts of postsynaptic spikes without presynaptic stimulation. Induction of these heterosynaptic changes depended on the rise of intracellular calcium, and their direction and magnitude correlated with initial state of release mechanisms. We suggest that this type of plasticity serves as a mechanism that stabilizes the distribution of synaptic weights and prevents their runaway dynamics. To test this hypothesis, we develop a cortical neuron model implementing both homosynaptic (STDP) and heterosynaptic plasticity with properties matching the experimental data. We find that heterosynaptic plasticity effectively prevented runaway dynamics for the tested range of STDP and input parameters. Synaptic weights, although shifted from the original, remained normally distributed and nonsaturated. Our study presents a biophysically constrained model of how the interaction of different forms of plasticity-Hebbian and heterosynaptic-may prevent runaway synaptic dynamics and keep synaptic weights unsaturated and thus capable of further plastic changes and formation of new memories. © 2013 the authors.},

	abstract = {Slow oscillatory activity ({\textless}1 Hz) is observed in vivo in the cortex during slow-wave sleep or under anesthesia and in vitro when the bath solution is chosen to more closely mimic cerebrospinal fluid. Here we present a biophysical network model for the slow oscillations observed in vitro that reprouces the single neuron behaviors and collective network firing patterns in control as well as under pharmacological manipulations. The membrane potential of a neuron oscillates slowly (at {\textless}1 Hz) between a down state and an up state; the up state is maintained by strong recurrent excitation balanced by inhibition, and the transition to the down state is due to a slow adaptation current (Na+-dependent K+ current). Consistent with in vivo data, the input resistance of a model neuron, on average, is the largest at the end of the down state and the smallest during the initial phase of the up state. An activity wave is initiated by spontaneous spike discharges in a minority of neurons, and propagates across the network at a speed of 3-8 mm/s in control and 20-50 mm/s with inhibition block. Our work suggests that long-range excitatory patchy connections contribute significantly to this wave propagation. Finally, we show with this model that various known physiological effects of neuromodulation can switch the network to tonic firing, thus simulating a transition to the waking state.},

	doi = {10.1038/nrn.2017.151},
	abstract = {During inattentive wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, the neocortex and thalamus cooperatively engage in rhythmic activities that are exquisitely reflected in the electroencephalogram as distinctive rhythms spanning a range of frequencies from {\textless}1 Hz slow waves to 13 Hz alpha waves. In the thalamus, these diverse activities emerge through the interaction of cell-intrinsic mechanisms and local and long-range synaptic inputs. One crucial feature, however, unifies thalamic oscillations of different frequencies: repetitive burst firing driven by voltage-dependent Ca 2+ spikes. Recent evidence reveals that thalamic Ca 2+ spikes are inextricably linked to global somatodendritic Ca 2+ transients and are essential for several forms of thalamic plasticity. Thus, we propose herein that alongside their rhythm-regulation function, thalamic oscillations of low-vigilance states have a plasticity function that, through modifications of synaptic strength and cellular excitability in local neuronal assemblies, can shape ongoing oscillations during inattention and NREM sleep and may potentially reconfigure thalamic networks for faithful information processing during attentive wakefulness.},

	doi = {10.1113/jphysiol.2006.123588},
	abstract = {During wakefulness and sleep, neurons in the neocortex emit action potentials tonically or in rhythmic bursts, respectively. However, the role of synchronized discharge patterns is largely unknown. We have recently shown that pairings of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and action potential bursts or single spikes lead to long-term depression (burst-LTD) or long-term potentiation, respectively. In this study, we elucidate the cellular mechanisms of burst-LTD and characterize its functional properties. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from layer V pyramidal cells in somatosensory cortex of juvenile rats in vitro and composite EPSPs and EPSCs were evoked extracellularly in layers II/III. Repetitive burst-pairings led to a long-lasting depression of EPSPs and EPSCs that was blocked by inhibitors of metabotropic glutamate group 1 receptors, phospholipase C, protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, and that required an intact machinery for endocytosis. Thus, burst-LTD is induced via a Ca2+ - and phosphatidylinositol-dependent activation of PKC and expressed through phosphorylation-triggered endocytosis of AMPA receptors. Functionally, burst-LTD is inversely related to EPSP size and bursts dominate single spikes in determining the sign of synaptic plasticity. Thus burst-firing constitutes a signal by which coincident synaptic inputs are proportionally downsized. Overall, our data thus suggest a mechanism by which synaptic weights can be reconfigured during non-rapid eye movement sleep. © 2007 The Authors.

	abstract = {The idea that sleep might be involved in brain plasticity has been investigated for many years through a large number of animal and human studies, but evidence remains fragmentary. Large amounts of sleep in early life suggest that sleep may play a role in brain maturation. In particular, the influence of sleep in developing the visual system has been highlighted. The current data suggest that both Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and non-REM sleep states would be important for brain development. Such findings stress the need for optimal paediatric sleep management. In the adult brain, the role of sleep in learning and memory is emphasized by studies at behavioural, systems, cellular and molecular levels. First, sleep amounts are reported to increase following a learning task and sleep deprivation impairs task acquisition and consolidation. At the systems level, neurophysiological studies suggest possible mechanisms for the consolidation of memory traces. These imply both thalamocortical and hippocampo-neocortical networks. Similarly, neuroimaging techniques demonstrated the experience-dependent changes in cerebral activity during sleep. Finally, recent works show the modulation during sleep of cerebral protein synthesis and expression of genes involved in neuronal plasticity. © 2006 Taylor \& Francis.},

We measured 6920 synapses in mouse motor and sensory cortices using three-dimensional electron microscopy. The axon-spine interface (ASI) decreased ∼18\% after sleep compared with wake. This decrease was proportional to ASI size, which is indicative of scaling. Scaling was selective, sparing synapses that were large and lacked recycling endosomes. Similar scaling occurred for spine head volume, suggesting a distinction between weaker, more plastic synapses (∼80\%) and stronger, more stable synapses. These results support the hypothesis that a core function of sleep is to renormalize overall synaptic strength increased by wake.},

These results support the proposal that a core function of sleep is to renormalize the increase in synaptic strength associated with ongoing learning during wake, to reestablish cellular homeostasis and avoid runaway potentiation, synaptic saturation, and memory interference [2, 3]. Before adolescence however, when the brain is still growing and many new synapses are forming, sleep is widely believed to promote synapse formation and growth. To assess the role of sleep on synapses early in life, we studied 2-week-old mouse pups (both sexes) whose brain is still undergoing significant developmental changes, but in which sleep and wake are easy to recognize. In two strains (CD-1, YFP-H) we found that pups spend {\textasciitilde}50\% of the day asleep and show an immediate increase in total sleep duration after a few hours of enforced wake, indicative of sleep homeostasis. In YFP-H pups we then used serial block-face electron microscopy to examine whether the axon-spine interface (ASI), an ultrastructural marker of synaptic strength, changes between wake and sleep. We found that the ASI of cortical synapses (layer 2, motor cortex) was on average 33.9\% smaller after sleep relative to after extended wake and the differences between conditions were consistent with multiplicative scaling. Thus, the need for sleep-dependent synaptic renormalization may apply also to the young, pre-weaned cerebral cortex, at least in the superficial layers of the primary motor area.},

	abstract = {Memory consolidation transforms initially labile memory traces into more stable representations. One putative mechanism for consolidation is the reactivation of memory traces after their initial encoding during subsequent sleep or waking state. However, it is still unknown whether consolidation of individual memory contents relies on reactivation of stimulus-specific neural representations in humans. Investigating stimulus-specific representations in humans is particularly difficult, but potentially feasible using multivariate pattern classification analysis (MVPA). Here, we show in healthy human participants that stimulus-specific activation patterns can indeed be identified with MVPA, that these patterns reoccur spontaneously during postlearning resting periods and sleep, and that the frequency of reactivation predicts subsequent memory for individual items. We conducted a paired-associate learning task with items and spatial positions and extracted stimulus-specific activity patterns by MVPA in a simultaneous electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. As a first step, we investigated the amount of fMRI volumes during rest that resembled either one of the items shown before or one of the items shown as a control after the resting period. Reactivations during both awake resting state and sleep predicted subsequent memory. These data are first evidence that spontaneous reactivation of stimulus-specific activity patterns during resting state can be investigated using MVPA. They show that reactivation occurs in humans and is behaviorally relevant for stabilizing memory traces against interference. They move beyond previous studies because replay was investigated on the level of individual stimuli and because reactivations were not evoked by sensory cues but occurred spontaneously. © 2013 the authors.},

	abstract = {Declarative long-term memories are not created in an instant. Gradual stabilization and temporally shifting dependence of acquired declarative memories in different brain regions-called systems consolidation-can be tracked in time by lesion experiments. The observation of temporally graded retrograde amnesia (RA) following hippocampal lesions points to a gradual transfer of memory from hippocampus to neocortical long-term memory. Spontaneous reactivations of hippocampal memories, as observed in place cell reactivations during slow-wave-sleep, are supposed to drive neocortical reinstatements and facilitate this process. We propose a functional neural network implementation of these ideas and furthermore suggest an extended three-state framework that includes the prefrontal cortex (PFC). It bridges the temporal chasm between working memory percepts on the scale of seconds and consolidated long-term memory on the scale of weeks or months. We show that our three-stage model can autonomously produce the necessary stochastic reactivation dynamics for successful episodic memory consolidation. The resulting learning system is shown to exhibit classical memory effects seen in experimental studies, such as retrograde and anterograde amnesia (AA) after simulated hippocampal lesioning; furthermore the model reproduces peculiar biological findings on memory modulation, such as retrograde facilitation of memory after suppressed acquisition of new long-term memories-similar to the effects of benzodiazepines on memory. © 2014 Fiebig and Lansner.},

One leading proposal, known as the synaptic renormalization hypothesis, suggests that sleep is necessary to counteract a global strengthening of synapses that occurs during wakefulness. Evidence for sleep-dependent synaptic downscaling (or synaptic renormalization) has been observed experimentally, but the physiological mechanisms which generate this phenomenon are unknown. In this study, we propose that changes in neuronal membrane excitability induced by acetylcholine may provide a dynamical mechanism for both wake-dependent synaptic upscaling and sleep-dependent downscaling. We show in silico that cholinergically-induced changes in network firing patterns alter overall network synaptic potentiation when synaptic strengths evolve through spike-timing dependent plasticity mechanisms. Specifically, network synaptic potentiation increases dramatically with high cholinergic concentration and decreases dramatically with low levels of acetylcholine. We demonstrate that this phenomenon is robust across variation of many different network parameters. © 2013 Fink et al.},

There remain, however, important challenges and unanswered questions. For example, sleep does not appear to have a single effect on synaptic strength. An unbiased review of the literature indicates that the effects of sleep vary widely depending on ontogenetic stage, the type of waking experience (or stimulation protocols) that precede sleep and the type of neuronal synapse under examination.

	abstract = {Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is critical for cortical circuit refinement. The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis suggests that synaptic connections are strengthened during wake and downscaled during sleep; however, it is not obvious how the same plasticity rules could explain both outcomes. Using whole-cell recordings and optogenetic stimulation of presynaptic input in urethane-anesthetized mice, which exhibit slow-wave-sleep (SWS)-like activity, we show that synaptic plasticity rules are gated by cortical dynamics in vivo. While Down states support conventional spike timing-dependent plasticity, Up states are biased toward depression such that presynaptic stimulation alone leads to synaptic depression, while connections contributing to postsynaptic spiking are protected against this synaptic weakening. We find that this novel activity-dependent and input-specific downscaling mechanism has two important computational advantages: (1) improved signal-to-noise ratio, and (2) preservation of previously stored information. Thus, these synaptic plasticity rules provide an attractive mechanism for SWS-related synaptic downscaling and circuit refinement. González-Rueda et al. show that presynaptic activation during slow-wave-sleep-like activity in vivo causes synaptic depression, unless it contributes to postsynaptic spiking. This plasticity rule offers an attractive mechanism for circuit refinement that improves signal-to-noise ratio and preserves previously stored information.},

	abstract = {In a companion paper (1), we used computer simulations to show that a strategy of activity-dependent, on-line net synaptic potentiation during wake, followed by off-line synaptic depression during sleep, can provide a parsimonious account for several memory benefits of sleep at the systems level, including the consolidation of procedural and declarative memories, gist extraction, and integration of new with old memories. In this paper, we consider the theoretical benefits of this two-step process at the single-neuron level and employ the theoretical notion of Matching between brain and environment to measure how this process increases the ability of the neuron to capture regularities in the environment and model them internally. We show that down-selection during sleep is beneficial for increasing or restoring Matching after learning, after integrating new with old memories, and after forgetting irrelevant material. By contrast, alternative schemes, such as additional potentiation in wake, potentiation in sleep, or synaptic renormalization in wake, decrease Matching. We also argue that, by selecting appropriate loops through the brain that tie feedforward synapses with feedback ones in the same dendritic domain, different subsets of neurons can learn to specialize for different contingencies and form sequences of nested perception-action loops. By potentiating such loops when interacting with the environment in wake, and depressing them when disconnected from the environment in sleep, neurons can learn to match the long-term statistical structure of the environment while avoiding spurious modes of functioning and catastrophic interference. Finally, such a two-step process has the additional benefit of desaturating the neuron's ability to learn and of maintaining cellular homeostasis. Thus, sleep-dependent synaptic renormalization offers a parsimonious account for both cellular and systems level effects of sleep on learning and memory. © 2013 Hashmi, Nere and Tononi.},

We briefly illustrate how sleep measurement and the evolution, tissue organization levels, molecular mechanisms, and regulation of sleep could influence one's view of sleep function. Then we discuss six viable theories of sleep function. Sleep serves host-defense mechanisms and conserves caloric expenditures, but these functions likely are opportunistic functions evolving later in evolution. That sleep replenishes brain energy stores and that sleep serves a glymphatic function by removing toxic byproducts of waking activity are attractive ideas, but lack extensive supporting experimental evidence. That sleep restores performance is experimentally demonstrated and has obvious evolutionary value. However, this hypothesis lacks experimentally verified mechanisms although ideas relating to this issue are presented. Finally, the ideas surrounding the broad hypothesis that sleep serves a connectivity/plasticity function are many and attractive. There is experimental evidence that connectivity changes with sleep, sleep loss, and with changing afferent input, and that those changes are linked to sleep regulatory mechanisms. In our view, this is the leading contender for the primordial function of sleep. However, much refinement of ideas and innovative experimental approaches are needed to clarify the sleep-connectivity relationship.},

	abstract = {It has been known since the time of patient H. M. and Karl Lashley’s equipotentiality studies that the hippocampus and cortex serve mnestic functions. Current memory models maintain that these two brain structures accomplish unique, but interactive, memory functions. Specifically, most modeling suggests that memories are rapidly acquired during waking experience by the hippocampus, before being later consolidated into the cortex for long-term storage. Sleep has been shown to be critical for the transfer and consolidation of memories in the cortex. Like memory consolidation, a role for sleep in adaptive forgetting has both historical precedent, as Francis Crick suggested in 1983 that sleep was for “reverse-learning,” and recent empirical support. In this article I review the evidence indicating that the same brain activity involved in sleep replay associated memory consolidation is responsible for sleep-dependent forgetting. In reviewing the literature, it became clear that both a cellular mechanism for systems consolidation and an agreed upon general, as well as cellular, mechanism for sleep-dependent forgetting is seldom discussed or is lacking. I advocate here for a candidate cellular systems consolidation mechanism wherein changes in calcium kinetics and the activation of consolidative signaling cascades arise from the triple phase locking of non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) slow oscillation, sleep spindle and sharp-wave ripple rhythms. I go on to speculatively consider several sleep stage specific forgetting mechanisms and conclude by discussing a notional function of NREM-rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) cycling. The discussed model argues that the cyclical organization of sleep functions to first lay down and edit and then stabilize and integrate engrams. All things considered, it is increasingly clear that hallmark sleep stage rhythms, including several NREMS oscillations and the REMS hippocampal theta rhythm, serve the dual function of enabling simultaneous memory consolidation and adaptive forgetting. Specifically, the same sleep rhythms that consolidate new memories, in the cortex and hippocampus, simultaneously organize the adaptive forgetting of older memories in these brain regions.},

	abstract = {The hippocampus plays important roles in memory formation and retrieval through sharp-wave-ripples. Recent studies have shown that certain neuron populations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) exhibit coordinated reactivations during awake ripple events. These experimental findings suggest that the awake ripple is an important biomarker, through which the hippocampus interacts with the neocortex to assist memory formation and retrieval. However, the computational mechanisms of this ripple based hippocampal-cortical coordination are still not clear due to the lack of unified models that include both the hippocampal and cortical networks. In this work, using a coupled biophysical model of both CA1 and PFC, we investigate possible mechanisms of hippocampal-cortical memory trace transfer and the conditions that assist reactivation of the transferred memory traces in the PFC. To validate our model, we first show that the local field potentials generated in the hippocampus and PFC exhibit ripple range activities that are consistent with the recent experimental studies. Then we demonstrate that during ripples, sequence replays can successfully transfer the information stored in the hippocampus to the PFC recurrent networks. We investigate possible mechanisms of memory retrieval in PFC networks. Our results suggest that the stored memory traces in the PFC network can be retrieved through two different mechanisms, namely the cell-specific input representing external stimuli and non-specific spontaneous background noise representing spontaneous memory recall events. Importantly, in both cases, the memory reactivation quality is robust to network connection loss. Finally, we find out that the quality of sequence reactivations is enhanced by both increased number of SWRs and an optimal background noise intensity, which tunes the excitability of neurons to a proper level. Our study presents a mechanistic explanation for the memory trace transfer from the hippocampus to neocortex through ripple coupling in awake states and reports two different mechanisms by which the stored memory traces can be successfully retrieved.},

Conversely, when activity in the network is random, the same rules can have a coupling and synchronizing influence. The presence of these opposing forces promotes the self-organization of spontaneously active neuronal networks to a state at the border between randomness and synchrony. The decoupling force of STDP may be engaged by the synchronous bursts occurring in the hippocampus during slow-wave sleep, leading to the selective erasure of information from hippocampal circuits as memories are established in neocortical areas. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The enhancement of normal cognition and breakthrough treatments in cognitive disorders require an improved understanding of memory consolidation. Insights into the mechanisms of memory consolidation have been advanced by the incorporation of a quantifiable variable: sleep. Over the past 20 years, a substantial number of studies have shown that memory performance is facilitated after a bout of sleep, compared with the same period of waking, implicating a slow, offline process during sleep that transforms the memory trace into a more robust form through a consolidation process. Until recently, the majority of these studies have examined cognitive tasks that utilize non-declarative, procedural memory (e.g., knowing " how" , learning actions, habits, perceptual and motor skills, and implicit learning) to show enhanced performance above baseline. Recent attention has turned to studying the relationship between sleep and declarative memory, which refers to consciously accessible memories of fact-based information (i.e., knowing " what" , in terms of events, places, and general knowledge) that are dependent on the hippocampus. Although the exact nature of the relationship between sleep and declarative memory consolidation is hotly debated, there is strong emerging evidence for the importance of slow wave sleep. In contrast with the " enhancement" model of procedural memory, there are two declarative memory models; first, the active model, in which memory depends on sleep specifically; and second, the permissive model, which posits a time-dependent, interference-sensitive process that opportunistically seizes any period of dampened hippocampal input to further process prior, learned information. We review the evidence for the active and permissive models and discuss areas of research that would benefit from future studies. Bridging these scientific fields will impact fundamental research in memory, sleep and pharmacology, as well as have relevance for treatment of memory impairments affecting people with mental illness and age-related cognitive decline. © 2010 Taiwan Medical University.},

	doi = {10.1152/jn.00593.2010},
	abstract = {Recent evidence indicates that net synaptic strength in cortical and other networks increases during wakefulness and returns to a baseline level during sleep. These homeostatic changes in synaptic strength are accompanied by corresponding changes in sleep slow wave activity (SWA) and in neuronal firing rates and synchrony. Other evidence indicates that sleep is associated with an initial reactivation of learned firing patterns that decreases over time. Finally, sleep can enhance performance of learned tasks, aid memory consolidation, and desaturate the ability to learn. Using a large-scale model of the corticothalamic system equipped with a spike-timing dependent learning rule, in agreement with experimental results, we demonstrate a net increase in synaptic strength in the waking mode associated with an increase in neuronal firing rates and synchrony. In the sleep mode, net synaptic strength decreases accompanied by a decline in SWA. We show that the interplay of activity and plasticity changes implements a control loop yielding an exponential, self-limiting renormalization of synaptic strength. Moreover, when the model "learns" a sequence of activation during waking, the learned sequence is preferentially reactivated during sleep, and reactivation declines over time. Finally, sleepdependent synaptic renormalization leads to increased signal-to-noise ratios, increased resistance to interference, and desaturation of learning capabilities. Although the specific mechanisms implemented in the model cannot capture the variety and complexity of biological substrates, and will need modifications in line with future evidence, the present simulations provide a unified, parsimonious account for diverse experimental findings coming from molecular, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches.

	abstract = {Research findings over the past two decades have supported a link between sleep states and synaptic plasticity. Numerous mechanistic hypotheses have been put forth to explain this relationship. For example, multiple studies have shown structural alterations to synapses (including changes in synaptic volume, spine density, and receptor composition) indicative of synaptic weakening after a period of sleep. Direct measures of neuronal activity and synaptic strength support the idea that a period of sleep can reduce synaptic strength. This has led to the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY), which asserts that during slow wave sleep, synapses are downscaled throughout the brain to counteract net strengthening of network synapses during waking experience (e.g., during learning). However, neither the cellularmechanismsmediating these synaptic changes, nor the sleep-dependent activity changes driving those cellular events are well-defined. Here we discuss potential cellular and network dynamicmechanisms which could underlie reductions in synaptic strength during sleep. We also discuss recent findings demonstrating circuit-specific synaptic strengthening (rather than weakening) during sleep. Based on these data, we explore the hypothetical role of sleep-associated network activity patterns in driving synaptic strengthening. We propose an alternative to SHY—namely that depending on experience during prior wake, a variety of plasticity mechanisms may operate in the brain during sleep. We conclude that either synaptic strengthening or synaptic weakening can occur across sleep, depending on changes to specific neural circuits (such as gene expression and protein translation) induced by experiences in wake. Clarifying the mechanisms underlying these different forms of sleep-dependent plasticity will significantly advance our understanding of how sleep benefits various cognitive functions.},

	abstract = {Associative synaptic plasticity is synapse specific and requires coincident activity in pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons to activate NMDA receptors (NMDARs). The resultant Ca(2+) influx is the critical trigger for the induction of synaptic plasticity. Given its centrality for the induction of synaptic plasticity, a model for NMDAR activation incorporating the timing of pre-synaptic glutamate release and post-synaptic depolarization by back-propagating action potentials could potentially predict the pre- and post-synaptic spike patterns required to induce synaptic plasticity. We have developed such a model by incorporating currently available data on the timecourse and amplitude of the post-synaptic membrane potential within individual spines. We couple this with data on the kinetics of synaptic NMDARs and then use the model to predict the continuous spine [Ca(2+)] in response to regular or irregular pre- and post-synaptic spike patterns. We then incorporate experimental data from synaptic plasticity induction protocols by regular activity patterns to couple the predicted local peak [Ca(2+)] to changes in synaptic strength. We find that our model accurately describes [Ca(2+)] in dendritic spines resulting from NMDAR activation during pre-synaptic and post-synaptic activity when compared to previous experimental observations. The model also replicates the experimentally determined plasticity outcome of regular and irregular spike patterns when applied to a single synapse. This model could therefore be used to predict the induction of synaptic plasticity under a variety of experimental conditions and spike patterns.},

Our data indicate that relevant items that subjects strived to memorize are consolidated during sleep to a greater extent than items that participants did not intend to learn.

	abstract = {The brain stores memories by persistently changing the connectivity between neurons. Sleep is known to be critical for these changes to endure. Research on the neurobiology of sleep and the mechanisms of long-term synaptic plasticity has provided data in support of various theories of how brain activity during sleep affects long-term synaptic plasticity. The experimental findings – and therefore the theories – are apparently quite contradictory, with some evidence pointing to a role of sleep in the forgetting of irrelevant memories, whereas other results indicate that sleep supports the reinforcement of the most valuable recollections. A unified theoretical framework is in need. Computational modeling and simulation provide grounds for the quantitative testing and comparison of theoretical predictions and observed data, and might serve as a strategy to organize the rather complicated and diverse pool of data and methodologies used in sleep research. This review article outlines the emerging progress in the computational modeling and simulation of the main theories on the role of sleep in memory consolidation.},

However, how these different brain states work in concert to create long-lasting changes in brain circuitry is unclear. Considering that wakefulness and sleep are profoundly different brain states on multiple levels (e.g., cellular, molecular and network activation), it is unlikely that they operate exactly the same way. Rather it is probable that they engage different, but coordinated, mechanisms. In this article we discuss how plasticity may be divided across the sleep–wake cycle, and how synaptic changes in each brain state are linked. Our working model proposes that waking experience triggers short-lived synaptic events that are necessary for transient plastic changes and mark (i.e., ‘prime’) circuits and synapses for further processing in sleep. During sleep, synaptic protein synthesis at primed synapses leads to structural changes necessary for long-term information storage.},

With increasing evidence linking sleep states to changes in synaptic strength, an emerging view is that sleep promotes learning and memory by facilitating experience-induced synaptic plasticity. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on the function of sleep in regulating cortical synaptic plasticity. Specifically, we outline the electroencephalogram signatures of sleep states (e.g. slow-wave sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, spindles), sleep state-dependent changes in gene and synaptic protein expression, synaptic morphology, and neuronal and network activity. We highlight studies showing that post-experience sleep potentiates experience-induced synaptic changes and discuss the potential mechanisms that may link sleep-related brain activity to synaptic structural remodelling. We conclude that both synapse formation or strengthening and elimination or weakening occur across sleep. This sleep-dependent synaptic plasticity plays an important role in neuronal circuit refinement during development and after learning, while sleep disorders may contribute to or exacerbate the development of common neurological diseases.This article is part of the Theo Murphy meeting issue ‘Memory reactivation: replaying events past, present and future’.},

To address this challenge, we constructed a simple computational model, which recapitulates the electrophysiological characteristics of the slow-wave sleep and awake states. Comprehensive bifurcation analysis predicted that a Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization pathway may play a role in slow-wave sleep and hence in the regulation of sleep duration. To experimentally validate the prediction, we generate and analyze 21 KO mice. Here we found that impaired Ca2+-dependent K+ channels (Kcnn2 and Kcnn3), voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (Cacna1g and Cacna1h), or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases (Camk2a and Camk2b) decrease sleep duration, while impaired plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (Atp2b3) increases sleep duration. Pharmacological intervention and whole-brain imaging validated that impaired NMDA receptors reduce sleep duration and directly increase the excitability of cells. Based on these results, we propose a hypothesis that a Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization pathway underlies the regulation of sleep duration in mammals. Video Abstract [Formula presented]},

	abstract = {Memory storage in the brain relies on mechanisms acting on time scales from minutes, for long-term synaptic potentiation, to days, for memory consolidation. During such processes, neural circuits distinguish synapses relevant for forming a long-term storage, which are consolidated, from synapses of short-term storage, which fade. How time scale integration and synaptic differentiation is simultaneously achieved remains unclear. Here we show that synaptic scaling - a slow process usually associated with the maintenance of activity homeostasis - combined with synaptic plasticity may simultaneously achieve both, thereby providing a natural separation of short- from long-term storage. The interaction between plasticity and scaling provides also an explanation for an established paradox where memory consolidation critically depends on the exact order of learning and recall. These results indicate that scaling may be fundamental for stabilizing memories, providing a dynamic link between early and late memory formation processes. © 2013 Tetzlaff et al.},

	abstract = {Conventional synaptic plasticity in combination with synaptic scaling is a biologically plausible plasticity rule that guides the development of synapses toward stability. Here we analyze the development of synaptic connections and the resulting activity patterns in different feed-forward and recurrent neural networks, with plasticity and scaling. We show under which constraints an external input given to a feed-forward network forms an input trace similar to a cell assembly (Hebb, 1949) by enhancing synaptic weights to larger stable values as compared to the rest of the network. For instance, a weak input creates a less strong representation in the network than a strong input which produces a trace along large parts of the network. These processes are strongly influenced by the underlying connectivity. For example, when embedding recurrent structures (excitatory rings, etc.) into a feed-forward network, the input trace is extended into more distant layers, while inhibition shortens it. These findings provide a better understanding of the dynamics of generic network structures where plasticity is combined with scaling. This makes it also possible to use this rule for constructing an artificial network with certain desired storage properties.},

	title = {A wake-sleep algorithm for recurrent, spiking neural networks},
	abstract = {We investigate a recently proposed model for cortical computation which performs relational inference. It consists of several interconnected, structurally equivalent populations of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, which are trained in a self-organized fashion with spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). Despite its robust learning dynamics, the model is susceptible to a problem typical for recurrent networks which use a correlation based (Hebbian) learning rule: if trained with high learning rates, the recurrent connections can cause strong feedback loops in the network dynamics, which lead to the emergence of attractor states. This causes a strong reduction in the number of representable patterns and a decay in the inference ability of the network. As a solution, we introduce a conceptually very simple “wake-sleep” algorithm: during the wake phase, training is executed normally, while during the sleep phase, the network “dreams” samples from its generative model, which are induced by random input. This process allows us to activate the attractor states in the network, which can then be unlearned effectively by an anti-Hebbian mechanism. The algorithm allows us to increase learning rates up to a factor of ten while avoiding clustering, which allows the network to learn several times faster. Also for low learning rates, where clustering is not an issue, it improves convergence speed and reduces the final inference error.},

In isolated cortical slabs (10 mm long, 6 mm wide and 4-5 mm deep), augmenting responses to pulse-trains at 10 Hz (responses with growing amplitudes from the second stimulus in a train) were elicited only by relatively high-intensity stimuli. At low intensities, responses were decremental. The largest augmenting responses were evoked in neurones located close to the stimulation site. Quantitative analyses of the number of action potentials and the amplitude and area of depolarization during augmenting responses in a population of neurones recorded from slabs showed that the most dramatic increases in the number of spikes with successive stimuli, and the greatest increase in depolarization amplitude, were found in conventional fast-spiking (FS) neurones. The largest increase in the area of depolarization was found in regular-spiking (RS) neurones. Dual intracellular recordings from a pair of FS and RS neurones in the slab revealed more action potentials in the FS neurone during augmenting responses and a significant increase in the depolarization area of the RS neurone that was dependent on the firing of the FS neurone. Self-sustained seizures could occur in the slab after rhythmic stimuli at 10 Hz. In the intact cortex, repeated sequences of stimuli generating augmenting responses or spontaneous spindles could induce an increased synaptic responsiveness to single stimuli, which lasted for several minutes. A similar time course of increased responsiveness was obtained with induction of cellular plasticity. These data suggest that augmenting responses elicited by stimulation, as well as spontaneously occurring spindles, may induce short- and medium-term plasticity of neuronal responses.},

	abstract = {Research in the neurosciences continues to provide evidence that sleep plays a role in the processes of learning and memory. There is less of a consensus, however, regarding the precise stages of memory development during which sleep is considered a requirement, simply favorable, or not important. This article begins with an overview of recent studies regarding sleep and learning, predominantly in the procedural memory domain, and is measured against our current understanding of the mechanisms that govern memory formation. Based on these considerations, I offer a new neurocognitive framework of procedural learning, consisting first of acquisition, followed by two specific stages of consolidation, one involving a process of stabilization, the other involving enhancement, whereby delayed learning occurs. Psychophysiological evidence indicates that initial acquisition does not rely fundamentally on sleep. This also appears to be true for the stabilization phase of consolidation, with durable representations, resistant to interference, clearly developing in a successful manner during time awake (or just time, per se). In contrast, the consolidation stage, resulting in additional/enhanced learning in the absence of further rehearsal, does appear to rely on the process of sleep, with evidence for specific sleep-stage dependencies across the procedural domain. Evaluations at a molecular, cellular, and systems level currently offer several sleep specific candidates that could play a role in sleep-dependent learning. These include the upregulation of select plasticity-associated genes, increased protein synthesis, changes in neurotransmitter concentration, and specific electrical events in neuronal networks that modulate synaptic potentiation. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.},

Here, we review this recent evidence and suggest that sleep creates a heightened state of plasticity, which may be essential for this optimization. Furthermore, we discuss how sleep deficits seen in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and autism spectrum disorders might not just reflect underlying circuit malfunction, but could also play a direct role in the progression of those disorders. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	doi = {10.3389/fnsyn.2010.00005},
	abstract = {Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) offers a powerful means of forming and modifying neural circuits. Experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated its potential usefulness for functions as varied as cortical map development, sharpening of sensory receptive fields, working memory, and associative learning. Even so, it is unlikely that STDP works alone. Unless changes in synaptic strength are coordinated across multiple synapses and with other neuronal properties, it is difficult to maintain the stability and functionality of neural circuits. Moreover, there are certain features of early postnatal development (e.g., rapid changes in sensory input) that threaten neural circuit stability in ways that STDP may not be well placed to counter. These considerations have led researchers to investigate additional types of plasticity, complementary to STDP, that may serve to constrain synaptic weights and/or neuronal firing. These are collectively known as "homeostatic plasticity" and include schemes that control the total synaptic strength of a neuron, that modulate its intrinsic excitability as a function of average activity, or that make the ability of synapses to undergo Hebbian modification depend upon their history of use. In this article, we will review the experimental evidence for homeostatic forms of plasticity and consider how they might interact with STDP during development, and learning and memory. © 2010 Watt and Desai.},

However, the underlying mechanisms of how sleep rhythms contribute to consolidating memories acquired during wakefulness remain unclear. Here we studied the role of slow oscillations, 0.2–1 Hz rhythmic transitions between Up and Down states during stage 3/4 sleep, on dynamics of synaptic connectivity in the thalamocortical network model implementing spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity. We found that the spatiotemporal pattern of Up-state propagation determines the changes of synaptic strengths between neurons. Furthermore, an external input, mimicking hippocampal ripples, delivered to the cortical network results in input-specific changes of synaptic weights, which persisted after stimulation was removed. These synaptic changes promoted replay of specific firing sequences of the cortical neurons. Our study proposes a neuronal mechanism on how an interaction between hippocampal input, such as mediated by sharp wave-ripple events, cortical slow oscillations, and synaptic plasticity, may lead to consolidation of memories through preferential replay of cortical cell spike sequences during slow-wave sleep.},

In this study, using a realistic computational model of the thalamocortical network, we tested the role of Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep in memory consolidation. We found that sleep spindles (the hallmark of N2 stage sleep) and slow oscillations (the hallmark of N3 stage sleep) both promote replay of the spike sequences learned in the awake state and replay was localized at the trained network locations. Memory performance improved after a period of NREM sleep but not after the same time period in awake. When multiple memories were trained, the local nature of the spike sequence replay during spindles allowed replay of the distinct memory traces independently, while slow oscillations promoted competition that could prevent replay of the weak memories in a presence of the stronger memory traces. This could lead to extinction of the weak memories unless when sleep spindles (N2 sleep) preceded slow oscillations (N3 sleep), as observed during the natural sleep cycle. Our study presents a mechanistic explanation for the role of sleep rhythms in memory consolidation and proposes a testable hypothesis how the natural structure of sleep stages provides an optimal environment to consolidate memories.},

New spines are formed on different sets of dendritic branches in response to different learning tasks and are protected from being eliminated when multiple tasks are learned. Neurons activated during learning of a motor task are reactivated during subsequent non-rapid eye movement sleep, and disrupting this neuronal reactivation prevents branch-specific spine formation.

Sensorimotor connections were made using a three-layered spiking neural network (SNN) with only one hidden-layer neuron and synapses with spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). In the SNN controller, synapses from the hidden-layer neuron to the motor neurons received presynaptic modulation signals from sensory neurons, a mechanism similar to that of the withdrawal reflex circuit of the sea slug, Aplysia. The synaptic weights were modified dependent on the firing rates of the presynaptic modulation signal and that of the hidden-layer neuron by STDP. In experiments using a real robot, which uses a similar simple SNN controller, the robot adapted quickly to the given environment in a single trial by organizing the weights, acquired navigation and obstacle-avoidance behavior. In addition, it followed dynamical changes in the environment. This associative learning scheme can be a new strategy for constructing adaptive agents with minimal structures, and may be utilized as an essential mechanism of an SNN ensemble that binds multiple sensory inputs and generates multiple motor outputs.

The mechanisms underlying this replay are not well understood. How can small synaptic footprints engraved by experience control large-scale network activity during memory retrieval and consolidation? We hypothesize that sparse and weak synaptic connectivity between Hebbian assemblies are boosted by pre-existing recurrent connectivity within them. To investigate this idea, we connect sequences of assemblies in randomly connected spiking neuronal networks with a balance of excitation and inhibition. Simulations and analytical calculations show that recurrent connections within assemblies allow for a fast amplification of signals that indeed reduces the required number of inter-assembly connections. Replay can be evoked by small sensory-like cues or emerge spontaneously by activity fluctuations. Global—potentially neuromodulatory—alterations of neuronal excitability can switch between network states that favor retrieval and consolidation.},

Model inputs consisted of words derived from normative data that differed in terms of connectivity and network size, with the former quantitatively represented by parametric weights and the latter by the specific number of word associates that formed a particular network. Previous behavioral studies of normal subjects indicated better recall for words of high connectivity-small network (HCSN), followed by low connectivity-small network (LCSN), high connectivity-large network (HCLN), and low connectivity-large network (LCLN). This pattern of recall differed from that observed in behavioral studies of schizophrenic patients, which showed better recall for high connectivity words, regardless of network size. Holding constant network size while manipulating connection weights effectively simulated this schizophrenic pattern of recall. That is, manipulation of parametric weights coupled with a slight increase in noise significantly and reliably elicited the response pattern of abnormal connectivity demonstrated in the prior behavioral study of patients with chronic schizophrenia. An increase in noise was a necessary, but insufficient step in modeling the response pattern of abnormal connectivity. These findings provide support for the use of computational models to investigate dynamics of associative word recall in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Keywords},

Here, we present a comprehensive description of the combined effect of both short-term facilitation and depression on noise-induced memory degradation in one-dimensional continuous attractor models. Our theoretical description, applicable to rate models as well as spiking networks close to a stationary state, accurately describes the slow dynamics of stored memory positions as a combination of two processes: (i) diffusion due to variability caused by spikes; and (ii) drift due to random connectivity and neuronal heterogeneity. We find that facilitation decreases both diffusion and directed drifts, while short-term depression tends to increase both. Using mutual information, we evaluate the combined impact of short-term facilitation and depression on the ability of networks to retain stable working memory. Finally, our theory predicts the sensitivity of continuous working memory to distractor inputs and provides conditions for stability of memory.},

	abstract = {Homeostatic processes that regulate electrical activity in neurones are now an established aspect of physiology and rest on a large body of experimental evidence that points to roles in development, learning and memory, and disease. However, the concepts underlying homeostasis are too often summarized in ways that restrict their explanatory power and obviate important subtleties. Here, we present a review of the underlying theory of homeostasis - control theory - in an attempt to reconcile some existing conceptual problems in the context of neuronal physiology. In addition to clarifying the underlying theory, this review highlights the remaining challenges posed when analysing homeostatic phenomena that underlie the regulation of neuronal excitability. Moreover, we suggest approaches for future experimental and computational work that will further our understanding of neuronal homeostasis and the fundamental neurophysiological functions it serves. © 2011 The Authors.

	abstract = {In spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), the order and precise temporal interval between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes determine the sign and magnitude of long-term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD). STDP is widely utilized in models of circuit-level plasticity, development, and learning. However, spike timing is just one of several factors (including firing rate, synaptic cooperativity, and depolarization) that govern plasticity induction, and its relative importance varies across synapses and activity regimes. This review summarizes this broader view of plasticity, including the forms and cellular mechanisms for the spike-timing dependence of plasticity, and, the evidence that spike timing is an important determinant of plasticity in vivo. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The elementary processing units in the brain are neurons (see Chapter 2) which are connected to each other via cable-like extensions, called axons and dendrites (see Chapter 3). The contact points between an axon terminal of a neuron A and the dendrite of another neuron B are called synapses. The most important synapses are chemical synapses, but there exist also electrical synapses which we will not consider further. When an action potential of neuron A arrives at the axon terminating at a chemical synapse, a chemical signal (neurotransmit-ter) is ejected into the synaptic cleft and taken up by receptors sitting on the membrane of the dendrite of the receiving neuron. Upon transmitter binding, an ion channel opens, ions flow into the cell and cause a change in the proper-ties of neuron B. This change can be measured as an Excitatory or Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP or IPSP) at the soma of the receiving neuron (see Chapter 3). The strength of an excitatory synaptic connection can be quantified by the amplitude of the EPSP. The most important insight for all the rest of chapter is that the strength of a synapse is not fixed, but can change.},

long-term, the propagation of neuronal information. Persistent changes in
intrinsic excitability have been reported in several brain areas in which
activity is elevated during a classical conditioning. The role of synaptic
activity seems to be a determinant in the induction, but the learning rules
and the underlying mechanisms remain to be defined. We discuss here the role
of synaptic activity in the induction of intrinsic plasticity in cortical,
hippocampal, and cerebellar neurons. Activation of glutamate receptors
initiates a long-term modification in neuronal excitability that may represent
a parallel, synergistic substrate for learning and memory. Similar to synaptic
plasticity, long-lasting intrinsic plasticity appears to be bidirectional and
to express a certain level of input or cell specificity. These nonsynaptic
forms of plasticity affect the signal propagation in the axon, the dendrites,
and the soma. They not only share common learning rules and induction pathways
with the better-known synaptic plasticity such as NMDA receptor dependent LTP
and LTD, but also contribute in synergy with these synaptic changes to the
formation of a coherent engram.},

	abstract = {In populations of synapses, overall synaptic strength can undergo either a net strengthening (long-term potentiation) or weakening (long-term depression). These phenomena have distinct induction pathways, but the functional outcome is usually measured as a single lumped quantity. In hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses, we took two approaches to study the activity dependence of each phenomenon in isolation. First, we selectively blocked one process by applying kinase or phosphatase inhibitors known, respectively, to block potentiation or depression. Second, we saturated depression or potentiation and examined the activity dependence of the converse process. The resulting unidirectional learning rules could be recombined to give a well-known bidirectional frequency-dependent learning rule under the assumption that when both pathways are activated kinases dominate, resulting in potentiation. Saturation experiments revealed an additional process in which potentiated synapses can be locked at high strength. Saturability of the components of plasticity implies that the amount of plasticity contributed by each pathway depends on the initial level of strength of the synapses. Variation in the distribution of initial synaptic strengths predicts a form of metaplasticity and can account for differences in learning rules observed under several physiological and genetic manipulations.},

	abstract = {Spike-timing–dependent plasticity (STDP) is considered as a primary mechanism underlying formation of new memories during learning. Despite the growing interest in activity-dependent plasticity, it is still unclear whether synaptic plasticity rules inferred from in vitro experiments are correct in physiological conditions. The abnormally high calcium concentration used in in vitro studies of STDP suggests that in vivo plasticity rules may differ significantly from in vitro experiments, especially since STDP depends strongly on calcium for induction. We therefore studied here the influence of extracellular calcium on synaptic plasticity. Using a combination of experimental (patch-clamp recording and Ca
              2+
              imaging at CA3-CA1 synapses) and theoretical approaches, we show here that the classic STDP rule in which pairs of single pre- and postsynaptic action potentials induce synaptic modifications is not valid in the physiological Ca
              2+
              range. Rather, we found that these pairs of single stimuli are unable to induce any synaptic modification in 1.3 and 1.5 mM calcium and lead to depression in 1.8 mM. Plasticity can only be recovered when bursts of postsynaptic spikes are used, or when neurons fire at sufficiently high frequency. In conclusion, the STDP rule is profoundly altered in physiological Ca
              2+
              , but specific activity regimes restore a classical STDP profile.},

	abstract = {N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play a critical role in transducing neuronal activity patterns into changes in synaptic strength. However, how they mediate this transduction in response to physiological stimuli has remained elusive. In particular, it has been debated whether different NMDAR subtypes play opposing signaling roles in synaptic plasticity. Using perforated patch-clamp recordings from pairs of synaptically connected glutamatergic neurons in dissociated hippocampal culture, we found that spike-timing-dependent potentiation induced by pairing pre- and postsynaptic spikes required the activation of a fast component of NMDAR current that is likely to be mediated by NR2A-containing NMDARs (NR2A-NRs). In contrast, spike-timing-dependent depression required a slow component of NMDAR current carried by NR2B-containing NMDARs (NR2B-NRs). CV analysis showed that the locus of this depression was primarily presynaptic in pairs of cells making strong synaptic connections, whereas weaker synapses showed no clear preference for pre- or postsynaptic expression. This depression was not significantly reduced by antagonism of the CB1 receptor, in contrast to spike-timing-dependent depression in the neocortex that requires presynaptic CB1 signaling. With blockade of NR2B-NRs, spike triplets that contained both potentiating and depressing spike-timing components induced net potentiation. However, when the putative NR2A-NR population is inhibited, these spike triplets resulted in either depression or no net change, depending on the temporal order of the spike-timing components. These results imply a dynamic competition between signaling modules that can be biased by differentially antagonizing NMDAR subtypes during the induction of spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Using a simple model, we show that such a modular competition recapitulates our observations.},

	abstract = {This article attempts an overview of the mechanism of NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and its role in hippocampal networks. Efforts are made to integrate information, often in speculative ways, and to identify unresolved issues about the induction, expression and molecular storage processes. The pre/post debate about LTP expression has been particularly difficult to resolve. The following hypothesis attempts to reconcile the available physiological evidence as well as anatomical evidence that LTP increases synapse size. It is proposed that synapses are composed of a variable number of trans-synaptic modules, each having presynaptic release sites and a postsynaptic structure that can be AMPAfied by the addition of a hyperslot assembly that anchors 10-20 AMPA channels. According to a newly developed view of transmission, the quantal response is generated by AMPA channels near the site of vesicle release and so will depend on whether the module where release occurs has been AMPAfied. LTP expression may involve two structurally mediated processes: (i) the AMPAfication of existing modules by addition of hyperslot assemblies: this is a purely postsynaptic process and produces an increase in the probability of an AMPA response, with no change in the NMDA component; and (ii) the addition of new modules: this is a structurally coordinated pre/post process that leads to LTP-induced synapse enlargement and potentiation of the NMDA component owing to an increase in the number of release sites (the number of NMDA channels is assumed to be fixed). The protocol used for LTP induction appears to affect the proportion of these two processes; pairing protocols that involve low-frequency presynaptic stimulation induce only AMPAfication, making LTP purely postsynaptic, whereas high-frequency stimulation evokes both processes, giving rise to a presynaptic component. This model is capable of reconciling much of the seemingly contradictory evidence in the pre/post debate. The structural nature of the postulated changes is relevant to a second debate: whether a CaMKII switch or protein-dependent structural change is the molecular memory mechanism. A possible reconciliation is that a reversible CaMKII switch controls the construction of modules and hyperslot assemblies from newly synthesized proteins.},

All these processes target neuron intrinsic properties and connectivity to achieve specific physiological goals, raising the question of how they can operate without interfering with each other. Here, we highlight the central importance of a timescale separation in the activation of sodium and T-type calcium channels to sustain robust switches in brain states in thalamic neurons that are compatible with synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation. We quantify the role of this timescale separation by comparing the robustness of rhythms of six published conductance-based models at the cellular, circuit and network levels. We show that robust rhythm generation requires a T-type calcium channel activation whose kinetics are situated between sodium channel activation and T-type calcium channel inactivation in all models despite their quantitative differences.},

Receptor co-agonists, glycine and D-serine, have intriguingly emerged as potential regulators of the receptor trafficking in addition to their requirement for its activation. Using a combination of single-molecule imaging, biochemistry and electrophysiology, we show that glycine and D-serine relative availability at rat hippocampal glutamatergic synapses regulate the trafficking and synaptic content of NMDAR subtypes. Acute manipulations of co-agonist levels, both ex vivo and in vitro, unveil that D-serine alter the membrane dynamics and content of GluN2B-NMDAR, but not GluN2A-NMDAR, at synapses through a process requiring PDZ binding scaffold partners. In addition, using FRET-based FLIM approach, we demonstrate that D-serine rapidly induces a conformational change of the GluN1 subunit intracellular C-terminus domain. Together our data fuels the view that the extracellular microenvironment regulates synaptic NMDAR signaling.},

Recent work has shown that dendrites play an active role in transforming synaptic input into neuronal output and in defining the relationships between active synapses. In this review, we discuss how these dendritic properties influence the rules governing the induction of synaptic plasticity. We argue that the location of synapses in the dendritic tree, and the type of dendritic excitability associated with each synapse, play decisive roles in determining the plastic properties of that synapse. Furthermore, since the electrical properties of the dendritic tree are not static, but can be altered by neuromodulators and by synaptic activity itself, we discuss how learning rules may be dynamically shaped by tuning dendritic function. We conclude by describing how this reciprocal relationship between plasticity of dendritic excitability and synaptic plasticity has changed our view of information processing and memory storage in neuronal networks.},

          , 
            Cortical neurons receive balanced excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents. Such a balance could be established and maintained in an experience-dependent manner by synaptic plasticity at inhibitory synapses. We show that this mechanism provides an explanation for the sparse firing patterns observed in response to natural stimuli and fits well with a recently observed interaction of excitatory and inhibitory receptive field plasticity. The introduction of inhibitory plasticity in suitable recurrent networks provides a homeostatic mechanism that leads to asynchronous irregular network states. Further, it can accommodate synaptic memories with activity patterns that become indiscernible from the background state but can be reactivated by external stimuli. Our results suggest an essential role of inhibitory plasticity in the formation and maintenance of functional cortical circuitry.},

	abstract = {Spike timing–dependent synaptic plasticity (STDP) has emerged as the preferred framework linking patterns of pre- and postsynaptic activity to changes in synaptic strength. Although synaptic plasticity is widely believed to be a major component of learning, it is unclear how STDP itself could serve as a mechanism for general purpose learning. On the other hand, algorithms for reinforcement learning work on a wide variety of problems, but lack an experimentally established neural implementation. Here, we combine these paradigms in a novel model in which a modified version of STDP achieves reinforcement learning. We build this model in stages, identifying a minimal set of conditions needed to make it work. Using a performance-modulated modification of STDP in a two-layer feedforward network, we can train output neurons to generate arbitrarily selected spike trains or population responses. Furthermore, a given network can learn distinct responses to several different input patterns. We also describe in detail how this model might be implemented biologically. Thus our model offers a novel and biologically plausible implementation of reinforcement learning that is capable of training a neural population to produce a very wide range of possible mappings between synaptic input and spiking output.},

Therefore, the investigation of neural mechanisms underlying reward functions requires behavioral theories that can conceptualize the different effects of rewards on behavior. The scientific investigation of behavioral processes by animal learning theory and economic utility theory has produced a theoretical framework that can help to elucidate the neural correlates for reward functions in learning, goal-directed approach behavior, and decision making under uncertainty. Individual neurons can be studied in the reward systems of the brain, including dopamine neurons, orbitofrontal cortex, and striatum. The neural activity can be related to basic theoretical terms of reward and uncertainty, such as contiguity, contingency, prediction error, magnitude, probability, expected value, and variance.},

	abstract = {Sleep spindles are burst-like signals in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of the sleeping mammalian brain and electrical surface correlates of neuronal oscillations in thalamus. As one of the most inheritable sleep EEG signatures, sleep spindles probably reflect the strength and malleability of thalamocortical circuits that underlie individual cognitive profiles. We review the characteristics, organization, regulation and origins of sleep spindles and their implication in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) and its functions, focusing on human and rodent. Spatially, sleep spindle-related neuronal activity appears on scales ranging from small thalamic circuits to functional cortical areas, and generates a cortical state favoring intracortical plasticity while limiting cortical output. Temporally, sleep spindles are discrete events, part of a continuous power band, and elements grouped on an infraslow time scale over which NREMS alternates between continuity and fragility. We synthetize diverse and seemingly unlinked functions of sleep spindles for sleep architecture, sensory processing, synaptic plasticity, memory formation and cognitive abilities into a unifying sleep spindle concept, according to which sleep spindles a) generate neural conditions of large-scale functional connectivity and plasticity that outlast their appearance as discrete EEG events, b) appear preferentially in thalamic circuits engaged in learning and attention-based experience during wakefulness c) enable a selective re-activation and routing of wake-instated neuronal traces between brain areas such as hippocampus and cortex. Their fine spatiotemporal organization reflects NREMS as a physiological state coordinated over brain and body and may indicate, if not anticipate and ultimately differentiate, pathologies in sleep and neurodevelopmental, -degenerative and -psychiatric conditions.},

Local rhythms serve cortical area-specific sleep needs and functions; however, mechanisms controlling locality are unclear. We identify the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) as a source for local, sensory-cortex-specific non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) in mouse. Neurons in optogenetically identified sensory TRN sectors showed stronger repetitive burst discharge compared to non-sensory TRN cells due to higher activity of the low-threshold Ca 2+ channel Ca V 3.3. Major NREMS rhythms in sensory but not non-sensory cortical areas were regulated in a Ca V 3.3-dependent manner. In particular, NREMS in somatosensory cortex was enriched in fast spindles, but switched to delta wave-dominated sleep when Ca V 3.3 channels were genetically eliminated or somatosensory TRN cells chemogenetically hyperpolarized. Our data indicate a previously unrecognized heterogeneity in a powerful forebrain oscillator that contributes to sensory-cortex-specific and dually regulated NREMS, enabling local sleep regulation according to use-and experience-dependence.},

We briefly illustrate how sleep measurement and the evolution, tissue organization levels, molecular mechanisms, and regulation of sleep could influence one's view of sleep function. Then we discuss six viable theories of sleep function. Sleep serves host-defense mechanisms and conserves caloric expenditures, but these functions likely are opportunistic functions evolving later in evolution. That sleep replenishes brain energy stores and that sleep serves a glymphatic function by removing toxic byproducts of waking activity are attractive ideas, but lack extensive supporting experimental evidence. That sleep restores performance is experimentally demonstrated and has obvious evolutionary value. However, this hypothesis lacks experimentally verified mechanisms although ideas relating to this issue are presented. Finally, the ideas surrounding the broad hypothesis that sleep serves a connectivity/plasticity function are many and attractive. There is experimental evidence that connectivity changes with sleep, sleep loss, and with changing afferent input, and that those changes are linked to sleep regulatory mechanisms. In our view, this is the leading contender for the primordial function of sleep. However, much refinement of ideas and innovative experimental approaches are needed to clarify the sleep-connectivity relationship.},

And also the hallmarks of sleep – sleep stage specific oscillations – are characterized themselves by up and down as seen within the slow oscillation or theta cycles. In this review, we summarize the up and down of sleep covering molecules to electrophysiology and present different theories how this up and down could be regulated by the up and down of sleep oscillations. Further, we propose a tentative theory how this differential up and down could contribute to various outcomes of sleep related memory consolidation: enhancement of hippocampal representations of very novel memories and cortical consolidation of memories congruent with previous knowledge-networks.},

	abstract = {In spite of the uniform appearance of sleep as a behavior, the sleeping brain does not produce electrical activities in unison. Different types of brain rhythms arise during sleep and vary between layers, areas, or from one functional system to another. Local heterogeneity of such activities, here referred to as local sleep, overturns fundamental tenets of sleep as a globally regulated state. However, little is still known about the neuronal circuits involved and how they can generate their own specifically-tuned sleep patterns. NREM sleep patterns emerge in the brain from interplay of activity between thalamic and cortical networks. Within this fundamental circuitry, it now turns out that the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) acts as a key player in local sleep control. This is based on a marked heterogeneity of the TRN in terms of its cellular and synaptic architecture, which leads to a regional diversity of NREM sleep hallmarks, such as sleep spindles, delta waves and slow oscillations. This provides first evidence for a subcortical circuit as a determinant of cortical local sleep features. Here, we review novel cellular and functional insights supporting TRN heterogeneity and how these elements come together to account for local NREM sleep. We also discuss open questions arising from these studies, focusing on mechanisms of sleep regulation and the role of local sleep in brain plasticity and cognitive functions.},

	abstract = {Effective connectivity between cortical areas decreases during slow wave sleep. This decline can be observed in the reduced interareal propagation of activity evoked either directly in cortex by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or by sensory stimulation. We present here a large-scale model of the thalamocortical system that is capable of reproducing these experimental observations. This model was constructed according to a large number of physiological and anatomical constraints and includes over 30,000 spiking neurons interconnected by more than 5 million synaptic connections and organized into three cortical areas. By simulating the different effects of arousal promoting neuromodulators, the model can produce a waking or a slow wave sleep-like mode. In this work, we also seek to explain why intercortical signal transmission decreases in slow wave sleep. The traditional explanation for reduced brain responses during this state, a thalamic gate, cannot account for the reduced propagation between cortical areas. Therefore we propose that a cortical gate is responsible for this diminished intercortical propagation. We used our model to test three candidate mechanisms that might produce a cortical gate during slow wave sleep: a propensity to enter a local down state following perturbation, which blocks the propagation of activity to other areas, increases in potassium channel conductance that reduce neuronal responsiveness, and a shift in the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition toward inhibition, which decreases network responses to perturbation. Of these mechanisms, we find that only a shift in the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition can account for the observed in vivo response to direct cortical perturbation as well as many features of spontaneous sleep.},

	abstract = {The link between the combined action of neuromodulators in the brain and global brain states remains a mystery. In this study, using biophysically realistic models of the thalamocortical network, we identified the critical intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms, associated with the putative action of acetylcholine (ACh), GABA and monoamines, which lead to transitions between primary brain vigilance states (waking, non-rapid eye movement sleep [NREM] and REM sleep) within an ultradian cycle. Using ECoG recordings from humans and LFP recordings from cats and mice, we found that during NREM sleep the power of spindle and delta oscillations is negatively correlated in humans and positively correlated in animal recordings. We explained this discrepancy by the differences in the relative level of ACh. Overall, our study revealed the critical intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms through which different neuromodulators acting in combination result in characteristic brain EEG rhythms and transitions between sleep stages.
          , 
            There are several stages of sleep that cycle repeatedly through the night with each producing distinctive patterns of electrical activity in the brain. It is thought that these patterns may help us to remember things that have happened throughout the day. Cells in parts of the brain called the hypothalamus and the brainstem control transitions between sleep stages. They regulate the release of chemicals known as neuromodulators in many parts of the brain, including the cortex and thalamus, which play the roles in memory and learning. Researchers now know how the neuromodulators influence the properties of individual brain cells. However, it is not clear how coordinated action of many neuromodulators result in the patterns of electrical activity seen in the brain during each stage of sleep.
            Krishnan et al. used a computer model to investigate how three of these neuromodulators – acetylcholine, histamine and GABA – shift electrical activity in the brain between sleep stages. The computer model was able to recreate the network of brain cells in the cortex and thalamus and how this network responds to the changes in the levels of neuromodulators. The study found that simultaneous and balanced changes of acetylcholine, histamine, and GABA work together to shift the brain between the stages of sleep and to initiate patterns of the brain electrical activity specific to the different sleep stages.
            Krishnan et al. predict that the relative differences in the level of acetylcholine in the brains of humans, cats and mice may explain why different species have different patterns of electrical activity during sleep. The study also found that an anesthetic drug called propofol may induce sleep-like patterns of electrical activity in the human brain by affecting the levels of all three of the neuromodulators. More studies are needed to look at how the networks of cells in the cortex and thalamus communicate with the brainstem, and how changes in the levels of neuromodulators affect memory and learning.},

	abstract = {Sleep and circadian rhythms are regulated across multiple functional, spatial and temporal levels: from genes to networks of coupled neurons and glial cells, to large scale brain dynamics and behaviour. The dynamics at each of these levels are complex and the interaction between the levels is even more so, so research have mostly focused on interactions within the levels to understand the underlying mechanisms—the so-called reductionist approach. Mathematical models were developed to test theories of sleep regulation and guide new experiments at each of these levels and have become an integral part of the ﬁeld. The advantage of modelling, however, is that it allows us to simulate and test the dynamics of complex biological systems and thus provides a tool to investigate the connections between the different levels and study the system as a whole. In this paper I review key models of sleep developed at different physiological levels and discuss the potential for an integrated systems biology approach for sleep regulation across these levels. I also highlight the necessity of building mechanistic connections between models of sleep and circadian rhythms across these levels.},

To address this challenge, we constructed a simple computational model, which recapitulates the electrophysiological characteristics of the slowwave sleep and awake states. Comprehensive bifurcation analysis predicted that a Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization pathway may play a role in slowwave sleep and hence in the regulation of sleep duration. To experimentally validate the prediction, we generate and analyze 21 KO mice. Here we found that impaired Ca2+-dependent K+ channels (Kcnn2 and Kcnn3), voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (Cacna1g and Cacna1h), or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases (Camk2a and Camk2b) decrease sleep duration, while impaired plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (Atp2b3) increases sleep duration. Pharmacological intervention and whole-brain imaging validated that impaired NMDA receptors reduce sleep duration and directly increase the excitability of cells. Based on these results, we propose a hypothesis that a Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization pathway underlies the regulation of sleep duration in mammals.},

This BVP model serves as a simple representative of a class of excitable-oscillatory systems including the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model of the squid giant axon. The BVP phase plane can be divided into regions corresponding to the physiological states of nerve fiber (resting, active, refractory, enhanced, depressed, etc.) to form a "physiological state diagram," with the help of which many physiological phenomena can be summarized. A properly chosen projection from the 4-dimensional HH phase space onto a plane produces a similar diagram which shows the underlying relationship between the two models. Impulse trains occur in the BVP and HH models for a range of constant applied currents which make the singular point representing the resting state unstable.},

Although the physiological phenomena have been well characterized, little consensus of their underlying molecular mechanisms has emerged. One reason for this may be the under-appreciated complexity of the signaling pathways that can arise if key signaling molecules are discretely localized within the synapse. Recent findings suggest an unanticipated degree of structural organization at the synapse, and improved methods in cellular imaging of living tissue have provided much-needed information about the intracellular dynamics of Ca2þ, thought to be critical for both LTP and LTD. In this review, we briefly summarize some of these developments, and show that a more complete understanding of cellular signaling depends on the successful integration of traditional biochemistry and molecular biology with the spatial and temporal details of synaptic ultrastructure. Biophysically realistic computer simulations can have an important role in bridging these disciplines. BioEssays 24:1130–1144, 2002.},

	abstract = {NMDA receptor dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are two prominent forms of synaptic plasticity, both of which are triggered by post-synaptic calcium elevation. To understand how calcium selectively stimulates two opposing processes, we developed a detailed computational model and performed simulations with different calcium input frequencies, amplitudes, and durations. We show that with a total amount of calcium ions kept constant, high frequencies of calcium pulses stimulate calmodulin more efficiently. Calcium input activates both calcineurin and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) at all frequencies, but increased frequencies shift the relative activation from calcineurin to CaMKII. Irrespective of amplitude and duration of the inputs, the total amount of calcium ions injected adjusts the sensitivity of the system to calcium input frequencies. At a given frequency, the quantity of CaMKII activated is proportional to the total amount of calcium. Thus, an input of a small amount of calcium at high frequencies can induce the same activation of CaMKII as a larger amount, at lower frequencies. Finally, the extent of activation of CaMKII signals with high calcium frequency is further controlled by other factors, including the availability of calmodulin, and by the potency of phosphatase inhibitors.},

            In many species, excitable cells preserve their physiological properties despite significant variation in physical size across time and in a population. For example, neurons in crustacean central pattern generators generate similar firing patterns despite several-fold increases in size between juveniles and adults. This presents a biophysical problem because the electrical properties of cells are highly sensitive to membrane area and channel density. It is not known whether specific mechanisms exist to sense membrane area and adjust channel expression to keep a consistent channel density, or whether regulation mechanisms that sense activity alone are capable of compensating cell size. We show that destabilising effects of growth can be specifically compensated by feedback mechanism that senses average calcium influx and jointly regulate multiple conductances. However, we further show that this class of growth-compensating regulation schemes is necessarily sensitive to perturbations that alter the expression of subsets of ion channel types. Targeted perturbations of specific ion channels can trigger a pathological response of the regulation mechanism and a failure of homeostasis. Our findings suggest that physiological regulation mechanisms that confer robustness to growth may be specifically vulnerable to deletions or mutations that affect subsets of ion channels.},

	abstract = {During inattentive wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, the neocortex and thalamus cooperatively engage in rhythmic activities that are exquisitely reflected in the electroencephalogram as distinctive rhythms spanning a range of frequencies from {\textless}1 Hz slow waves to 13 Hz alpha waves. In the thalamus, these diverse activities emerge through the interaction of cell-intrinsic mechanisms and local and long-range synaptic inputs. One crucial feature, however, unifies thalamic oscillations of different frequencies: repetitive burst firing driven by voltage-dependent Ca2+ spikes. Recent evidence reveals that thalamic Ca2+ spikes are inextricably linked to global somatodendritic Ca2+ transients and are essential for several forms of thalamic plasticity. Thus, we propose herein that alongside their rhythm-regulation function, thalamic oscillations of low-vigilance states have a plasticity function that, through modifications of synaptic strength and cellular excitability in local neuronal assemblies, can shape ongoing oscillations during inattention and NREM sleep and may potentially reconfigure thalamic networks for faithful information processing during attentive wakefulness.},

            It is assumed that synaptic strengthening and weakening balance throughout learning to avoid runaway potentiation and memory interference. However, energetic and informational considerations suggest that potentiation should occur primarily during wake, when animals learn, and depression should occur during sleep. We measured 6920 synapses in mouse motor and sensory cortices using three-dimensional electron microscopy. The axon-spine interface (ASI) decreased {\textasciitilde}18\% after sleep compared with wake. This decrease was proportional to ASI size, which is indicative of scaling. Scaling was selective, sparing synapses that were large and lacked recycling endosomes. Similar scaling occurred for spine head volume, suggesting a distinction between weaker, more plastic synapses ({\textasciitilde}80\%) and stronger, more stable synapses. These results support the hypothesis that a core function of sleep is to renormalize overall synaptic strength increased by wake.},

	abstract = {In adolescent and adult brains several molecular, electrophysiological, and ultrastructural measures of synaptic strength are higher after wake than after sleep [1, 2]. These results support the proposal that a core function of sleep is to renormalize the increase in synaptic strength associated with ongoing learning during wake, to reestablish cellular homeostasis and avoid runaway potentiation, synaptic saturation, and memory interference [2, 3]. Before adolescence however, when the brain is still growing and many new synapses are forming, sleep is widely believed to promote synapse formation and growth. To assess the role of sleep on synapses early in life, we studied 2-week-old mouse pups (both sexes) whose brain is still undergoing significant developmental changes, but in which sleep and wake are easy to recognize. In two strains (CD-1, YFP-H) we found that pups spend {\textasciitilde}50\% of the day asleep and show an immediate increase in total sleep duration after a few hours of enforced wake, indicative of sleep homeostasis. In YFP-H pups we then used serial block-face electron microscopy to examine whether the axon-spine interface (ASI), an ultrastructural marker of synaptic strength, changes between wake and sleep. We found that the ASI of cortical synapses (layer 2, motor cortex) was on average 33.9\% smaller after sleep relative to after extended wake and the differences between conditions were consistent with multiplicative scaling. Thus, the need for sleep-dependent synaptic renormalization may apply also to the young, pre-weaned cerebral cortex, at least in the superficial layers of the primary motor area.},

	abstract = {When the brain goes from wakefulness to sleep, cortical neurons begin to undergo slow oscillations in their membrane potential that are synchronized by thalamocortical circuits and reflected in EEG slow waves. To provide a self-consistent account of the transition from wakefulness to sleep and of the generation of sleep slow waves, we have constructed a large-scale computer model that encompasses portions of two visual areas and associated thalamic and reticular thalamic nuclei. Thousands of model neurons, incorporating several intrinsic currents, are interconnected with millions of thalamocortical, corticothalamic, and both intra- and interareal corticocortical connections. In the waking mode, the model exhibits irregular spontaneous firing and selective responses to visual stimuli. In the sleep mode, neuromodulatory changes lead to slow oscillations that closely resemble those observed in vivo and in vitro. A systematic exploration of the effects of intrinsic currents and network parameters on the initiation, maintenance, and termination of slow oscillations shows the following. 1) An increase in potassium leak conductances is sufficient to trigger the transition from wakefulness to sleep. 2) The activation of persistent sodium currents is sufficient to initiate the up-state of the slow oscillation. 3) A combination of intrinsic and synaptic currents is sufficient to maintain the up-state. 4) Depolarization-activated potassium currents and synaptic depression terminate the up-state. 5) Corticocortical connections synchronize the slow oscillation. The model is the first to integrate intrinsic neuronal properties with detailed thalamocortical anatomy and reproduce neural activity patterns in both wakefulness and sleep, thereby providing a powerful tool to investigate the role of sleep in information transmission and plasticity.},

Here, we assessed state-dependent evolution of calcium homeostasis in a population of hippocampal pyramidal neuron models, through an adaptation of a recent study on stomatogastric ganglion neurons. Calcium homeostasis was set to emerge through cell-autonomous updates to 12 ionic conductances, responding to different types of synaptically driven afferent activity. We first assessed the impact of theta-frequency inputs on the evolution of ionic conductances toward maintenance of calcium homeostasis. Although calcium homeostasis emerged efficaciously across all models in the population, disparate changes in ionic conductances that mediated this emergence resulted in variable plasticity to several intrinsic properties, also manifesting as significant differences in firing responses across models. Assessing the sensitivity of this form of plasticity, we noted that intrinsic neuronal properties and the firing response were sensitive to the target calcium concentration and to the strength and frequency of afferent activity. Next, we studied the evolution of calcium homeostasis when afferent activity was switched, in different temporal sequences, between two behaviorally distinct types of activity: theta-frequency inputs and sharp-wave ripples riding on largely silent periods. We found that the conductance values, intrinsic properties, and firing response of neurons exhibited differential robustness to an intervening switch in the type of afferent activity. These results unveil critical dissociations between different forms of homeostasis, and call for a systematic evaluation of the impact of state-dependent switches in afferent activity on neuronal intrinsic properties during neural coding and homeostasis.},

There is less of a consensus, however, regarding the precise stages of memory development during which sleep is considered a requirement, simply favorable, or not important. This article begins with an overview of recent studies regarding sleep and learning, predominantly in the procedural memory domain, and is measured against our current understanding of the mechanisms that govern memory formation. Based on these considerations, I offer a new neurocognitive framework of procedural learning, consisting first of acquisition, followed by two specific stages of consolidation, one involving a process of stabilization, the other involving enhancement, whereby delayed learning occurs. Psychophysiological evidence indicates that initial acquisition does not rely fundamentally on sleep. This also appears to be true for the stabilization phase of consolidation, with durable representations, resistant to interference, clearly developing in a successful manner during time awake (or just time, per se). In contrast, the consolidation stage, resulting in additional/enhanced learning in the absence of further rehearsal, does appear to rely on the process of sleep, with evidence for specific sleep-stage dependencies across the procedural domain. Evaluations at a molecular, cellular, and systems level currently offer several sleep specific candidates that could play a role in sleep-dependent learning. These include the upregulation of select plasticity-associated genes, increased protein synthesis, changes in neurotransmitter concentration, and specific electrical events in neuronal networks that modulate synaptic potentiation.},

Neuroﬁtter is a software tool that interfaces existing neural simulation software and sophisticated optimization algorithms with a new way to compute the error measure. This error measure represents how well a given parameter set is able to reproduce the experimental data. It is based on the phase-plane trajectory density method, which is insensitive to small phase differences between model and data. Neuroﬁtter enables the effortless combination of many different time-dependent data traces into the error measure, allowing the neuroscientist to focus on what are the seminal properties of the model. We show results obtained by applying Neuroﬁtter to a simple single compartmental model and a complex multi-compartmental Purkinje cell (PC) model. These examples show that the method is able to solve a variety of tuning problems and demonstrate details of its practical application.},

Fortunately, the parallel increase in computer power allows scientists to automate this tuning. Optimization algorithms need two essential components. The ﬁrst one is a function that measures the difference between the output of the model with a given set of parameter and the data. This error function or ﬁtness function makes the ranking of different parameter sets possible. The second component is a search algorithm that explores the parameter space to ﬁnd the best parameter set in a minimal amount of time. In this review we distinguish three types of error functions: feature-based ones, point-by-point comparison of voltage traces and multi-objective functions. We then detail several popular search algorithms, including brute-force methods, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, differential evolution and particle-swarm optimization. Last, we shortly describe Neuroﬁtter, a free software package that combines a phase–plane trajectory density ﬁtness function with several search algorithms.},

	abstract = {Excessive burst firing in the dopamine-depleted basal ganglia correlates with severe motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease that are attenuated by high frequency electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Here we test the hypothesis that pathological bursts in dopamine-deprived basal ganglia are generated within the STN and transmitted to globus pallidus neurons.To answer this question we recorded excitatory synaptic currents and potentials from subthalamic and pallidal neurons in the basal ganglia slice (BGS) from dopamine-depleted mice while continuously blocking GABAA receptors. In control mice, a single electrical stimulus delivered to the internal capsule or the rostral pole of the STN evoked a short duration, small amplitude, monosynaptic EPSC in subthalamic neurons. In contrast, in the dopamine-depleted BGS, this monosynaptic EPSC was amplified and followed by a burst of polysynaptic EPSCs that eventually reverberated three to seven times, providing a long lasting response that gave rise to bursts of EPSCs and spikes in GP neurons. Repetitive (10–120 Hz) stimulation delivered to the STN in the dopamine-depleted BGS attenuated STN-evoked bursts of EPSCs in pallidal neurons after several minutes of stimulation but only high frequency (90–120 Hz) stimulation replaced them with small amplitude EPSCs at 20 Hz. We propose that the polysynaptic pathway within the STN amplifies subthalamic responses to incoming excitation in the dopamine-depleted basal ganglia, thereby transforming the STN into a burst generator and entraining pallidal neurons in pathogenic bursting activities. High frequency stimulation of the STN prevents the transmission of this pathological activity to globus pallidus and imposes a new glutamatergic synaptic noise on pallidal neurons.},

	abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The causes of PD in humans are still unknown, although metabolic characteristics of the neurons affected by the disease have been implicated in their selective susceptibility. Mitochondrial dysfunction and proteostatic stress are recognized to be important in the pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic PD, and they both culminate in bioenergetic deﬁcits. Exposure to calcium overload has recently emerged as a key determinant, and pharmacological treatment that inhibits Ca2+ entry diminishes neuronal damage in chemical models of PD. In this review, we ﬁrst introduce general concepts on neuronal Ca2+ signaling and then summarize the current knowledge on fundamental properties of substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons, on the role of the interplay between Ca2+ and dopamine signaling in neuronal activity and susceptibility to cell death. We also discuss the possible involvement of a “neglected” player, the Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 (NCS-1), which has been shown to participate to dopaminergic signaling by regulating dopamine dependent receptor desensitization in normal brain but, data supporting a direct role in PD pathogenesis are still missing. However, it is intriguing to speculate that the Ca2+-dependent modulation of NCS-1 activity could eventually counteract dopaminergic neurons degeneration.},

	abstract = {A computational model of the rat subthalamic nucleus projection neuron is constructed using electrophysiological and morphological data and a restricted set of channel specifications. The model cell exhibits a wide range of electrophysiological behaviors characteristic of rat subthalamic neurons. It reveals that a key set of three channels play a primary role in distinguishing behaviors: a high-voltage-activated calcium channel (Ca
              v
              1.2.-1.3), a low-voltage-activated calcium channel (Ca
              v

              Ca
              2.1–2.3). Short and long posthyperpolarization rebound responses, low-frequency rhythmic bursting ({\textless}1 Hz), higher-frequency rhythmic bursting (4–7 Hz), and slow action and depolarizing potentials are behaviors all mediated by the interaction of these channels. This interaction can generate a robust calcium-dependent extended depolarization in the dendrites (a depolarizing plateau). The diversity observed in the rat subthalamic physiology (such as short or long rebounds, or the presence of low-frequency rhythmic busting) can arise from alterations in both the density and distributions of these channel types and, consequently, their ability to generate this depolarizing plateau. A number of important predictions arise from the model. For example, blocking or disrupting the low-voltage-activated Ca
              v
              3.- calcium current should mute the emergence of rebound responses and rhythmic bursting. Conversely, increasing this channel current via large hyperpolarizing potentials in combination with partial blockade of the high-voltage-activated calcium channels should lead to the more experimentally elusive in vitro high-frequency bursting.},

	abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthlamic nucleus (STN) represents an effective treatment for medically refractory Parkinson’s disease; however, understanding of its effects on basal ganglia network activity remains limited. We constructed a computational model of the subthalamopallidal network, trained it to fit in vivo recordings from parkinsonian monkeys, and evaluated its response to STN DBS. The network model was created with synaptically connected single compartment biophysical models of STN and pallidal neurons, and stochastically defined inputs driven by cortical beta rhythms. A least mean square error training algorithm was developed to parameterize network connections and minimize error when compared to experimental spike and burst rates in the parkinsonian condition. The output of the trained network was then compared to experimental data not used in the training process. We found that reducing the influence of the cortical beta input on the model generated activity that agreed well with recordings from normal monkeys. Further, during STN DBS in the parkinsonian condition the simulations reproduced the reduction in GPi bursting found in existing experimental data. The model also provided the opportunity to greatly expand analysis of GPi bursting activity, generating three major predictions. First, its reduction was proportional to the volume of STN activated by DBS. Second, GPi bursting decreased in a stimulation frequency dependent manner, saturating at values consistent with clinically therapeutic DBS. And third, ablating STN neurons, reported to generate similar therapeutic outcomes as STN DBS, also reduced GPi bursting. Our theoretical analysis of stimulation induced network activity suggests that regularization of GPi firing is dependent on the volume of STN tissue activated and a threshold level of burst reduction may be necessary for therapeutic effect.},

	abstract = {Our current understanding of the basal ganglia (BG) has facilitated the creation of computational models that have contributed novel theories, explored new functional anatomy and demonstrated results complementing physiological experiments. However, the utility of these models extends beyond these applications. Particularly in neuromorphic engineering, where the basal ganglia’s role in computation is important for applications such as power efﬁcient autonomous agents and model-based control strategies. The neurons used in existing computational models of the BG, however, are not amenable for many low-power hardware implementations. Motivated by a need for more hardware accessible networks, we replicate four published models of the BG, spanning single neuron and small networks, replacing the more computationally expensive neuron models with an Izhikevich hybrid neuron. This begins with a network modeling action-selection, where the basal activity levels and the ability to appropriately select the most salient input is reproduced. A Parkinson’s disease model is then explored under normal conditions, Parkinsonian conditions and during subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (DBS). The resulting network is capable of replicating the loss of thalamic relay capabilities in the Parkinsonian state and its return under DBS. This is also demonstrated using a network capable of action-selection. Finally, a study of correlation transfer under different patterns of Parkinsonian activity is presented. These networks successfully captured the signiﬁcant results of the originals studies. This not only creates a foundation for neuromorphic hardware implementations but may also support the development of large-scale biophysical models. The former potentially providing a way of improving the efﬁcacy of DBS and the latter allowing for the efﬁcient simulation of larger more comprehensive networks.},

To explore the mechanism for STN burst firing in this setting, we augmented a previously published conductance-based computational model for single rat STN neurons to include both DIC and NMDA currents, fit to data from published electrophysiological recordings. Simulations show that with these additions, the model engages in bursting activity at {\textless}1 Hz in response to hyperpolarizing current injection and that this bursting exhibits several features observed experimentally in STN. Furthermore, a reduced model is used to show that the combination of NMDA and DIC currents, but not either alone, suffices to generate oscillations under hyperpolarizing current injection. STN neurons show enhanced burstiness in Parkinson's disease patients and experimental models of parkinsonism, and the burst mechanism studied presently could contribute to this effect.},

	abstract = {Burst firing in subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been suggested to be highly associated with the motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease, which result from a loss of dopamine. Although it is clinically very important to clarify the mechanism underlying the bursting dynamics, complex interactions between STN and other brain areas make it difficult to understand. In anesthetized rats, STN neurons exhibit low-frequency (  1 Hz) bursts, which are synchronous with cortical slow oscillations and are significantly strengthened by dopamine depletion. To reproduce these low-frequency bursts, we examine a conductance-based model of an STN neuron that includes NMDA-type glutamatergic inputs reflecting cortical oscillations. In addition, the neuron model contains GABAergic inhibitory inputs, which are assumed to result from the activities of globus pallidus (GP). We show that the STN neuron model can reproduce low-frequency bursts synchronized with cortical activity, in the presence of GABAergic inhibition. In addition, we demonstrate that increased GABA activity leads to enhanced burstiness whereas increased NMDA conductances mainly augment STN firing rate. The induction of burst firing additionally decreases the coherence between STN and cortical activities. These results may give insights into how the complicated interactions between the STN, cortex, and GP can modulate the dynamics of bursting oscillations in the basal ganglia.},

	abstract = {Because the subthalamic nucleus (STN) acts as a driving force of the basal ganglia, it is important to know how the activities of STN neurons are regulated. Previously, we have reported that a subset of STN neurons generates a plateau potential in a voltage-dependent manner. These plateau potentials can be evoked only when the cell is hyperpolarized. Here, to examine the mechanism of the voltage-dependent generation of the plateau potential in STN neurons, we constructed a conductance-based model of the plateau-generating STN neuron based on experimental observations and compared simulation results with recordings in slices. The model consists of a single compartment containing a Na

              current. The model could also reproduce the generation of a plateau potential as a rebound potential after termination of hyperpolarizing current injection.

	abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) and lesioning are two surgical techniques used in the treatment of advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD) in patients whose symptoms are not well controlled by drugs, or who experience dyskinesias as a side effect of medications. Although these treatments have been widely practiced, the mechanisms behind DBS and lesioning are still not well understood. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) are two common targets for both DBS and lesioning. Previous studies have indicated that DBS not only affects local cells within the target, but also passing axons within neighboring regions. Using a computational model of the basal ganglia-thalamic network, we studied the relative contributions of activation and silencing of local cells (LCs) and fibers of passage (FOPs) to changes in the accuracy of information transmission through the thalamus (thalamic fidelity), which is correlated with the effectiveness of DBS. Activation of both LCs and FOPs during STN and GPi-DBS were beneficial to the outcome of stimulation. During STN and GPi lesioning, effects of silencing LCs and FOPs were different between the two types of lesioning. For STN lesioning, silencing GPi FOPs mainly contributed to its effectiveness, while silencing only STN LCs did not improve thalamic fidelity. In contrast, silencing both GPi LCs and GPe FOPs during GPi lesioning contributed to improvements in thalamic fidelity. Thus, two distinct mechanisms produced comparable improvements in thalamic function: driving the output of the basal ganglia to produce tonic inhibition and silencing the output of the basal ganglia to produce tonic disinhibition. These results show the importance of considering effects of activating or silencing fibers passing close to the nucleus when deciding upon a target location for DBS or lesioning.},

	abstract = {Memories that last a lifetime are thought to be stored, at least in part, as persistent enhancement of the strength of particular synapses. The synaptic mechanism of these persistent changes, late long-term potentiation (L-LTP), depends on the state and number of specific synaptic proteins. Synaptic proteins, however, have limited dwell times due to molecular turnover and diffusion, leading to a fundamental question: how can this transient molecular machinery store memories lasting a lifetime? Because the persistent changes in efficacy are synapse-specific, the underlying molecular mechanisms must to a degree reside locally in synapses. Extensive experimental evidence points to atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) isoforms as key components involved in memory maintenance. Furthermore, it is evident that establishing long-term memory requires new protein synthesis. However, a comprehensive model has not been developed describing how these components work to preserve synaptic efficacies over time. We propose a molecular model that can account for key empirical properties of L-LTP, including its protein synthesis dependence, dependence on aPKCs, and synapse-specificity. Simulations and empirical data suggest that either of the two aPKC subtypes in hippocampal neurons, PKMζ and PKCι/λ, can maintain L-LTP, making the system more robust. Given genetic compensation at the level of synthesis of these PKC subtypes as in knockout mice, this system is able to maintain L-LTP and memory when one of the pathways is eliminated.},

Here we use 2-photon glutamate uncaging to stimulate individual spines while monitoring uncaging-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (uEPSPs) and Ca transients. We ﬁnd that, in CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute mouse hippocampal slices, CaV2.3 voltagesensitive Ca channels (VSCCs) are found selectively on spines and act locally to dampen uncaging-evoked Ca transients and somatic potentials. These effects are mediated by a regulatory loop that requires opening of CaV2.3 channels, voltage-gated Na channels, small conductance Ca-activated potassium (SK) channels, and NMDA receptors. Ca inﬂux through CaV2.3 VSCCs selectively activates SK channels, revealing the presence of functional Ca microdomains within the spine. Our results suggest that synaptic strength can be modulated by mechanisms that regulate voltage-gated conductances within the spine but do not alter the properties or numbers of synaptic glutamate receptors.},

	abstract = {We describe a method for determining intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2ϩ]) from single-wavelength fluorescence signals. In contrast to previous single-wavelength calibration methods, the proposed method does not require independent estimates of resting [Ca2ϩ] but relies on the measurement of fluorescence close to indicator saturation during an experiment. Consequently, it is well suited to [Ca2ϩ] indicators for which saturation can be achieved under physiological conditions. In addition, the method requires that the indicators have large dynamic ranges. Popular indicators such as Calcium Green-1 or Fluo-3 fulfill these conditions. As a test of the method, we measured [Ca2ϩ] in CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices using Oregon Green BAPTA-1 and 2-photon laser scanning microscopy (BAPTA: 1,2-bis(2aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,NЈ,NЈ-tetraacetic acid). Resting [Ca2ϩ] was 32–59 nM in the proximal apical dendrite. Monitoring action potential-evoked [Ca2ϩ] transients as a function of indicator loading yielded estimates of endogenous buffering capacity (44 – 80) and peak [Ca2ϩ] changes at zero added buffer (178 –312 nM). In young animals (postnatal days 14 –17) our results were comparable to previous estimates obtained by ratiometric methods (Helmchen et al., 1996, Biophys. J. 70:1069 –1081), and no significant differences were seen in older animals (P24 –28). We expect our method to be widely applicable to measurements of [Ca2ϩ] and [Ca2ϩ]-dependent processes in small neuronal compartments, particularly in the many situations that do not permit wavelength ratio imaging.},

	abstract = {Measurements of presynaptic calcium currents are vital to understanding the control of transmitter release. However, most presynaptic boutons in the vertebrate central nervous system are too small to allow electrical recordings of presynaptic calcium currents (ICprae). We therefore tested the possibility of measuring ICprae optically in boutons loaded with calcium-sensitive fluorophores. From a theoretical treatment of a system containing an endogenous buffer and an indicator, we determined the conditions necessary for the derivative of the stimulus-evoked change in indicator fluorescence to report ICprae accurately. Matching the calcium dissociation rates of the endogenous buffer and indicator allows the most precise optical measurements of ICprae. We tested our ability to measure ICprae in granule cells in rat cerebellar slices. The derivatives of stimulus-evoked fluorescence transients from slices loaded with the low-affinity calcium indicators magnesium green and mag-fura-5 had the same time courses and were unaffected by changes in calcium influx or indicator concentration. Thus both of these indicators were well suited to measuring ICprae. In contrast, the high-affinity indicator fura-2 distorted ICprae. The optically determined ICprae was well approximated by a Gaussian with a half-width of 650 ␮s at 24°C and 340 ␮s at 34°C.},

Here we monitored plasticity while systematically varying the rate, spike timing, and number of coincident afferents. These experiments demonstrate a novel form of cooperativity operating even when postsynaptic firing is evoked by current injection, and reveal a complex dependence of LTP and LTD on rate and timing. Based on these data, we constructed and tested three quantitative models of cortical plasticity. One of these models, in which spiketiming relationships causing LTP “win” out over those favoring LTD, closely fits the data and accurately predicts the build-up of plasticity during random firing. This provides a quantitative framework for predicting the impact of in vivo firing patterns on synaptic strength.},

We examine tLTD in neocortical layer 5 (L5) pyramidal pairs and find that tLTD is expressed presynaptically, implying retrograde signaling. CB1 agonists produce depression that mimics and occludes tLTD. This agonist-induced LTD requires presynaptic activity and NMDAR activation, but not postsynaptic Ca2؉ influx. Further experiments demonstrate the existence of presynaptic NMDARs that underlie the presynaptic activity dependence. Finally, manipulating cannabinoid breakdown alters the temporal window for tLTD. In conclusion, tLTD requires simultaneous activation of presynaptic NMDA and CB1 receptors. This novel form of coincidence detection may explain the temporal window of tLTD and may also impart synapse specificity to cannabinoid retrograde signaling.},

	abstract = {Neuromodulatory input, acting on G-protein coupled receptors, is essential for the induction of experience-dependent cortical plasticity. Here we report that G-coupled receptors in layer II/III of visual cortex control the polarity of synaptic plasticity through a pull-push regulation of LTP and LTD. In slices, receptors coupled to Gs promote LTP while suppressing LTD; conversely, receptors coupled to Gq11 promote LTD and suppress LTP. In vivo, the selective stimulation of Gs- or Gq11-coupled receptors brings the cortex into LTP-only or LTD-only states, which allows the potentiation or depression of targeted synapses with visual stimulation. The pull-push regulation of LTP/LTD occurs via direct control of the synaptic plasticity machinery and it is independent of changes in NMDAR activation or neuronal excitability. We propose these simple rules governing the pull-push control of LTP/LTD form a general metaplasticity mechanism that may contribute to neuromodulation of plasticity in other cortical circuits.},

	abstract = {SpiNNaker is a digital neuromorphic architecture, designed speciﬁcally for the low power simulation of large-scale spiking neural networks at speeds close to biological real-time. Unlike other neuromorphic systems, SpiNNaker allows users to develop their own neuron and synapse models as well as specify arbitrary connectivity. As a result SpiNNaker has proved to be a powerful tool for studying different neuron models as well as synaptic plasticity—believed to be one of the main mechanisms behind learning and memory in the brain. A number of Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity(STDP) rules have already been implemented on SpiNNaker and have been shown to be capable of solving various learning tasks in real-time. However, while STDP is an important biological theory of learning, it is a form of Hebbian or unsupervised learning and therefore does not explain behaviors that depend on feedback from the environment. Instead, learning rules based on neuromodulated STDP (three-factor learning rules) have been shown to be capable of solving reinforcement learning tasks in a biologically plausible manner. In this paper we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time how a model of three-factor STDP, with the third-factor representing spikes from dopaminergic neurons, can be implemented on the SpiNNaker neuromorphic system. Using this learning rule we ﬁrst show how reward and punishment signals can be delivered to a single synapse before going on to demonstrate it in a larger network which solves the credit assignment problem in a Pavlovian conditioning experiment. Because of its extra complexity, we ﬁnd that our three-factor learning rule requires approximately 2× as much processing time as the existing SpiNNaker STDP learning rules. However, we show that it is still possible to run our Pavlovian conditioning model with up to 1 × 104 neurons in real-time, opening up new research opportunities for modeling behavioral learning on SpiNNaker.},

Neural sequences are long, compared to the activation durations of participating neurons, and sequence coding is sparse. Numerous studies demonstrate that spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP), the primary known mechanism for temporal order learning in neurons, cannot organize networks to generate long sequences, raising the question of how such networks are formed. We show that heterosynaptic competition within single neurons, when combined with STDP, organizes networks to generate long unary activity sequences even without sequential training inputs. The network produces a diversity of sequences with a power law length distribution and exponent À1, independent of cellular time constants. We show evidence for a similar distribution of sequence lengths in the recorded premotor song activity of songbirds. These results suggest that neural sequences may be shaped by synaptic constraints and network circuitry rather than cellular time constants.},

	abstract = {Systems consolidation refers to the reorganization of memory over time across brain regions. Despite recent advancements in unravelling engrams and circuits essential for this process, the exact mechanisms behind engram cell dynamics and the role of associated pathways remain poorly understood. Here, we propose a computational model to address this knowledge gap that consists of a multi-region spiking recurrent neural network subject to biologically-plausible synaptic plasticity mechanisms. By coordinating the timescales of synaptic plasticity throughout the network and incorporating a hippocampus-thalamus-cortex circuit, our model is able to couple engram reactivations across these brain regions and thereby reproduce key dynamics of cortical and hippocampal engram cells along with their interdependencies. Decoupling hippocampal-thalamic-cortical activity disrupts engram dynamics and systems consolidation. Our modeling work also yields several testable predictions: engram cells in mediodorsal thalamus are activated in response to partial cues in recent and remote recall and are crucial for systems consolidation; hippocampal and thalamic engram cells are essential for coupling engram reactivations between subcortical and cortical regions; inhibitory engram cells have region-specific dynamics with coupled reactivations; inhibitory input to mediodorsal thalamus is critical for systems consolidation; and thalamocortical synaptic coupling is predictive of cortical engram dynamics and the retrograde amnesia pattern induced by hippocampal damage. Overall, our results suggest that systems consolidation emerges from concerted interactions among engram cells in distributed brain regions enabled by coordinated synaptic plasticity timescales in multisynaptic subcortical-cortical circuits.},

In vivo, arousal was linked to AMPA receptor-independent elevations of [K+]e concomitant with decreases in [Ca2+]e, [Mg2+]e, [H+]e, and the extracellular volume. Opposite, natural sleep and anesthesia reduced [K+]e, while increasing [Ca2+]e, [Mg2+]e, [H+]e, as well as the extracellular volume.

	abstract = {1. Intracellular recording in the in vitro slice preparation and whole-cell, patch-clamp recording of acutely dissociated neurons from the rat lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) were combined to study the Ca currents underlying their electrical responses. In slices from young animals (postnatal days 13-16), we found that dorsal LGN neurons have responses similar to those of adult preparations, including the presence of a low-threshold Ca spike (LTS). After enzymatic isolation of LGN neurons from the same animals, the firing properties appeared well preserved, as indicated by whole-cell, current-clamp recordings from dissociated multipolar cells (presumably geniculocortical relay neurons). 2. Two types of Ca currents were identified in voltage-clamped, isolated LGN neurons on the basis of their voltage dependency, pharmacology, and selectivity properties. These two currents resemble the low-voltage-activated (LVA) and high-voltage-activated (HVA) Ca channels found in rat sensory neurons (9). 3. The LVA current component required negative potentials (less than -80 mV) to deinactivate completely, started to activate around -60 mV and reached a plateau level around -25 mV. It peaked within 30-6 ms and decayed with a single time constant of approximately 24 ms at -20 mV. Its inactivation curve ranged from -100 to -40 mV, with a half-inactivation near -60 mV. The HVA current component could be isolated by holding the membrane potential positive to -60 mV, activated at potentials positive to -30 mV and peaked around +5 mV. The time-to-peak ranged from 30 to 6 ms in the voltage range from -30 to +35 mV and decayed very slowly with sustained depolarizing pulses (time constant ranged between 1,600 and 40 ms over the same voltage range). 4. The inactivation of LVA Ca current during depolarizing voltage steps was consistent with a voltage-dependent process. The recovery from inactivation after short (100 ms), inactivating prepulses displayed two exponential phases. The slower phase was predominant under conditions that induce large current flow through the membrane, suggesting a Ca-mediated mechanism. 5. The LVA current was preferentially blocked by 50 microM Ni2+, leaving the HVA currents almost unaltered. Fifty micromolars Cd2+, in contrast, seemed more effective in blocking the HVA component of the Ca current.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Thalamic relay cells fire in two distinct modes, burst or tonic, and the operative mode is dictated by the inactivation state of low-threshold, voltage-gated, transient (or T-type) Ca2ϩ channels. Tonic firing is seen when the T channels are inactivated via membrane depolarization, and burst firing is seen when the T channels are activated from a hyperpolarized state. These response modes have very different effects on the relay of information to the cortex. It had been thought that only tonic firing is seen in the awake, alert animal, but recent evidence from several species suggests that bursting may also occur. We have begun to explore this issue in macaque monkeys by recording from thalamic relay cells of unanesthetized, behaving animals. In the lateral geniculate nucleus, the thalamic relay for retinal information, we found that tonic mode dominated responses both during alert behavior as well as during sleep. We nonetheless found burst firing present during the vigilant, waking state. There was, however, considerably more burst mode firing during sleep than wakefulness. Surprisingly, we did not find the bursting during sleep to be rhythmic. We also recorded from relay cells of the somatosensory thalamus. Interestingly, not only did these somatosensory neurons exhibit much more burst mode activity than did geniculate cells, but bursting during sleep was highly rhythmic. It thus appears that the level and nature of relay cell bursting may not be constant across all thalamic nuclei.},

	abstract = {The thalamus has long been seen as responsible for relaying information on the way to the cerebral cortex, but it has not been until the last decade or so that the functional nature of this relay has attracted significant attention. Whereas earlier views tended to relegate thalamic function to a simple, machine-like relay process, recent research, reviewed in this article, demonstrates complicated circuitry and a rich array of membrane properties underlying the thalamic relay. It is now clear that the thalamic relay does not have merely a trivial function. Suggestions that the thalamic circuits and cell properties only come into play during certain phases of sleep to effectively disconnect the relay are correct as far as they go, but they are incomplete, because they fail to take into account interesting and variable properties of the relay that, we argue, occur during normal waking behavior. Although the specific function of the circuits and cellular properties of the thalamic relay for waking behavior is far from clear, we offer two related hypotheses based on recent experimental evidence. One is that the thalamus is not used just to relay peripheral information from, for example, visual, auditory, or cerebellar inputs, but that some thalamic nuclei are arranged instead to relay information from one cortical area to another. The second is that the thalamus is not a simple, passive relay of information to cortex but instead is involved in many dynamic processes that significantly alter the nature of the information relayed to cortex.},

Our data reveal (1) distinct modulations of VPM and Pom activity throughout NREM episodes, (2) a thalamic nucleus-speciﬁc phase-locking to cortical slow and spindle waves, (3) cell-speciﬁc subthreshold spindle oscillations in VPM neurons that only partially overlap with cortical spindles, and (4) that spindle features evolve throughout NREM episodes and vary according to the post-NREM state.

	abstract = {Thalamic neurons can exhibit two distinct firing modes: tonic and burst. In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the tonic mode appears as a relatively faithful relay of visual information from retina to cortex. The function of the burst mode is less understood. Its prevalence during slow-wave sleep (SWS) and linkage to synchronous cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) suggest that it has an important role during this form of sleep. Although not nearly as common, bursting can also occur during wakefulness. The goal of this study was to identify conditions that affect burst probability, and to compare burst incidence during sleeping and waking. LGN neurons are extraordinarily heterogenous in the degree to which they burst, during both sleeping and waking. Some LGN neurons never burst under any conditions during wakefulness, and several never burst during slow-wave sleep. During wakefulness, {\textless}1\% of action potentials were associated with bursting, whereas during sleep this fraction jumps to 18\%. Although bursting was most common during slow-wave sleep, more than 50\% of the bursting originated from 14\% of the LGN cells. Bursting during sleep was largely restricted to episodes lasting 1–5 s, with ∼47\% of these episodes being rhythmic and in the delta frequency range (0.5–4 Hz). In wakefulness, although visual stimulation accounted for the greatest number of bursts, it was still a small fraction of the total response (4\%, 742 bursts/17,744 cycles in 93 cells). We identified two variables that appeared to influence burst probability: size of the visual stimuli used to elicit responses and behavioral state. Increased stimulus size increased burst probability. We attribute this to the increased influence large stimuli have on a cell's inhibitory mechanisms. As with sleep, a large fraction of bursting originated from a small number of cells. During visual stimulation, 50\% of bursting was generated by 9\% of neurons. Increased vigilance was negatively correlated with burst probability. Visual stimuli presented during active fixation (i.e., when the animal must fixate on an overt fixation point) were less likely to produce bursting, than when the same visual stimuli were presented but no fixation point present (“passive” fixation). Such observations suggest that even brief departures from attentive states can hyperpolarize neurons sufficiently to de-inactivate the burst mechanism. Our results provide a new view of the temporal structure of bursting during slow-wave sleep; one that supports episodic rhythmic activity in the intact animal. In addition, because bursting could be tied to specific conditions within wakefulness, we suggest that bursting has a specific function within that state.},

              3.1 channels (Ca
              V
              3.1 knockout) during unconsciousness induced by ketamine or ethanol administration. Our findings indicate that Ca
              V
              3.1 KO mice displayed attenuated low-frequency oscillations in thalamocortical loops, especially in the 1- to 4-Hz delta band, compared with control mice (Ca
              V
              3.1 WT). Intriguingly, we also found that Ca
              V
              3.1 KO mice exhibited augmented high-frequency oscillations during unconsciousness. In a behavioral measure of unconsciousness dynamics, Ca
              V
              3.1 KO mice took longer to fall into the unconscious state than controls. In addition, such unconscious events had a shorter duration than those of control mice. The thalamocortical interaction level between mediodorsal thalamus and frontal cortex in Ca
              V
              3.1 KO mice was significantly lower, especially for delta band oscillations, compared with that of Ca

              V
              3.1 channel is required for the generation of a given set of thalamocortical rhythms during unconsciousness. Further, that thalamocortical resonant neuronal activity supported by this channel is important for the control of vigilance states.},

	abstract = {Ionic channels are gated aqueous pores whose conformational changes are driven by the electric field in the membrane. Gating may be studied by three electrical methods: ionic current transients, ionic current fluctuations, and "gating current," and probably occurs through a series of conformational changes in the channel leading to an all-or-nothing opening of the pore. When the potential is held constant, the gating steps come to equilibrium rather than reaching an energy-dissipating, cyclic steady state. The kinetic models now in use eventually need to be changed to correct disagreements with several recent studies. Diffusion of ions through open channels is very fast but involves many interactions of ions, pore, and solvent that lead to ionic selectivity, saturation, block, and flux coupling. Our description of the ionic fluxes can be improved by abandoning continuum models in favor of more structured ones. Problems to be solved include determining how many ions occupy a channel at once and what kind of energy barriers they must cross in traversing the membrane. Ultimately we will need to know the chemical structure of the whole system to understand how it functions.},

Visualization of calcium influx through channels that shape the burst and tonic firing modes of thalamic relay cells. J. Neurophysiol. 77: 2816–2825, 1997. Thalamic neurons have two firing modes: “tonic” and “burst.” During burst mode, both low-threshold (LT) and high-threshold (HT) calcium channels are activated, while in tonic mode, only the HT-type of calcium channel is activated. The calcium signals associated with each firing mode were investigated in rat thalamic slices using whole cell patch clamping and confocal calcium imaging. Action potentials were induced by direct current injection into thalamic relay cells loaded with a fluorescent calcium indicator. In both tonic and burst firing modes, large calcium signals were recorded throughout the soma and proximal dendrites. To map the distribution of the channels mediating these calcium fluxes, LT and HT currents were independently activated using specific voltage-clamp protocols. We focused on the proximal region of the cell (up to 50 μm from the soma) because it appeared to be well clamped. For a voltage pulse of a given size, the largest calcium signals were observed in the proximal dendrites with smaller signals occurring in the soma and nucleus. This was true for both LT and HT signals. Rapid imaging, using one-dimensional linescans, was used to more precisely localize the calcium influx. For both LT and HT channels, calcium influx occurred simultaneously throughout all imaged regions including the soma and proximal dendrites. The presence of sizable calcium signals in the dendrites, soma, and nucleus during both firing modes, and the presence of LT calcium channels in the proximal dendrite where sensory afferents synapse, have implications for both the electrical functioning of relay cells and the transmission of sensory information to cortex.},

These channels are low voltage-activated calcium channels that play a key role in cellular excitability and various physiological functions. Their dysfunction has been linked to several neurological disorders, including absence epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Recent studies have revealed that T-type channels are modulated by a variety of serine/threonine protein kinase pathways, which indicates the need for a systematic analysis of T-type channel phosphorylation. Here, we immunopurified Cav3.2 channels from rat brain, and we used high-resolution MS to construct the first, to our knowledge, in vivo phosphorylation map of a voltage-gated calcium channel in a mammalian brain. We identified as many as 34 phosphorylation sites, and we show that the vast majority of these sites are also phosphorylated on the human Cav3.2 expressed in HEK293T cells. In patch-clamp studies, treatment of the channel with alkaline phosphatase as well as analysis of dephosphomimetic mutants revealed that phosphorylation regulates important functional properties of Cav3.2 channels, including voltage-dependent activation and inactivation and kinetics. We also identified that the phosphorylation of a locus situated in the loop I-II S442/S445/T446 is crucial for this regulation. Our data show that Cav3.2 channels are highly phosphorylated in the mammalian brain and establish phosphorylation as an important mechanism involved in the dynamic regulation of Cav3.2 channel gating properties.},

	abstract = {T-type calcium channels (T-channels) contribute to a wide variety of physiological functions, especially in the cardiovascular and nervous systems. Recent studies using knock-out mouse models have been instrumental in documenting further the role of T-channels in sleep, heartbeat, pain and epilepsy. Importantly, several novel aspects of the regulation of these channels have been identiﬁed over the last few years, providing new insights into their physiological and pathophysiological roles. Here, we review recent evidence supporting that the Cav3 subunits of T-channels are modulated by endogenous ligands such as anandamide, zinc, redox and oxidizing agents, as well as G-protein and protein kinases pathways. The study of T-channel mutations associated with childhood absence epilepsy has also revealed new aspects of Cav3 subunit trafﬁcking. Collectively, these ﬁndings identify novel regulatory mechanisms involved in the ﬁne tuning of T-channel expression and activity, and offer new directions for the design of novel therapeutic strategies targeting these channels.},

	abstract = {1. To perform simulations of the various modes of action potential generation in thalamic relay neurons, we developed Hodgkin-and-Huxley style mathematical equations that describe the voltage dependence and kinetics of activation and inactivation of four different currents, including the transient, low-voltage-activated Ca2+ current (IT), the rapidly inactivating transient K+ current (IA), the slowly inactivating K+ current (IK2), and the hyperpolarization-activated, mixed cationic current (Ih). The modeled currents were derived either from acutely dissociated rat thalamic relay neurons (IT, IA, IK2), or from guinea pig thalamic relay cells maintained in slices in vitro (Ih). 2. The voltage dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation of IT, IA, and IK2 and the activation of Ih could be modeled with Boltzmann-style equations. Modeling of the behavior of IT to depolarizing steps in voltage clamp required the use of the constant field equation to relate permeability to T-current amplitude. The time constant of activation of IT was described by a continuous bell-shaped function with a maximum near 15 ms at threshold for activation (-75 mV) and 23 degrees C. Mathematical description of the kinetics of inactivation and removal of inactivation of this current required two separate functions. 3. The rapidly activating and inactivating K+ current IA was modeled by assuming two components with different time constants of inactivation. The kinetics of activation was described as a continuous function of voltage with the slowest time constant, near 2.5 ms, at threshold for activation (-60 mV) and 23 degrees C. In contrast, the kinetics of inactivation of both components were described as voltage independent, consistent with experimental data. The rate or removal of inactivation of both components of IA was described as continuously increasing with the degree of hyperpolarization. 4. The slowly inactivating K+ current IK2 was also modeled by assuming two components with different rates of inactivation. The kinetics of activation were described by a bell-shaped function with a maximum time constant near 80 ms at -40 mV and 23 degrees C, whereas threshold for activation was approximately -60 mV. Inactivation of both components was modeled as relatively independent of voltage, whereas removal of inactivation was described as a continuous function of membrane potential. 5. The hyperpolarization-activation cationic current, Ih, was modeled by assuming that the current activates with a single exponential relation and does not inactivate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {1. A model of the electrophysiological properties of single thalamocortical relay neurons in the rodent and cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus was constructed, based in part on the voltage dependence and kinetics of ionic currents detailed with voltage-clamp techniques. The model made the simplifying assumption of a single uniform compartment and incorporated a fast and transient Na+ current, INa; a persistent, depolarization-activated Na+ current, INap; a low-threshold Ca2+ current, I(T); a high-threshold Ca2+ current, IL; a Ca(2+)-activated K+ current, IC; a transient and depolarization-activated K+ current, IA; a slowly inactivating and depolarization-activated K+ current, IK2; a hyperpolarization-activated cation current, Ih; and K+ and Na+ leak currents IKleak and INaleak. 2. The effects of the various ionic currents on the electrophysiological properties of thalamocortical relay neurons were initially investigated through examining the effect of each current individually on passive membrane responses. The two leak currents, IKleak and INaleak, determined in large part the resting membrane potential and the apparent input resistance of the model neuron. Addition of IA resulted in a delay in the response of the model cell to a depolarizing current pulse, whereas addition of IK2, or IL combined with IC, resulted in a marked and prolonged decrease in the response to depolarization. Addition of Ih resulted in a depolarizing "sag" in response to hyperpolarization, whereas addition of IT resulted in a large rebound Ca2+ spike after hyperpolarization. Finally, addition of INap resulted in enhancement of depolarization. 3. The low-threshold Ca2+ spike of rodent neurons was successfully modeled with the active currents I(T), IL, IA, IC, and IK2. The low-threshold Ca2+ current I(T) generated the low-threshold Ca2+ spike. The transient K+ current IA slowed the rate of rise and reduced the peak amplitude of the low-threshold Ca2+ spike, whereas the slowly inactivating K+ current IK2 contributed greatly to the repolarization of the Ca2+ spike. Activation of IL during the peak of the Ca2+ spike led to activation of IC, which also contributed to the repolarization of the Ca2+ spike. Reduction of any one of the K+ currents resulted in an increase in the other two, thereby resulting in substantially smaller changes in the Ca2+ spike than would be expected on the basis of the amplitude of each ionic current alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {1. A model of the transient, low-threshold voltage-dependent (T-type) Ca2+ current is constructed using recent whole-cell voltage-clamp data from enzymatically isolated rat thalamocortical relay neurons. The T-type Ca2+ current is described according to the Hodgkin-Huxley scheme, using the m3h format, with rate constants determined from the experimental data (22-24 degrees C; extracellular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]o = 3 mM). 2. The T-type Ca2+ current inactivates rapidly during maintained depolarization (time constant, Tau h approximately 20 ms at -20 mV), yet recovery from inactivation is slow (time constant, Tau r approximately 270 ms at -80 mV). To reconcile these observations, a two-step kinetic scheme is proposed for the inactivation gate. Each of the time constants in this scheme is voltage dependent, with a maximum at about -85 mV (45 ms for one and 275 ms for the other). 3. Numerical simulations of recovery in a two-pulse, voltage-clamp protocol compare favorably with experimental results obtained by Coulter et al. as well as those obtained in an independent series of experiments with guinea pig thalamic neurons ([Ca2+]o = 10 mM). 4. For current-clamp simulations, a leakage current gL (V-VL) is included; with VL = -65 mV, the calculated resting membrane potential is -63 mV. 5. It is shown that the T-type Ca2+ current together with the leakage current suffices to describe the low-threshold spike (LTS), a slow, triangular-shaped depolarizing event that can be evoked only from relatively hyperpolarized membrane potentials and that underlies the burst firing of Na(+)-dependent action potentials in thalamic neurons. Outward currents are not required to reproduce the basic shape of the LTS. 6. The LTS can be activated with either a depolarizing current step from a sufficiently hyperpolarized level or on termination of a hyperpolarizing current step. In either case, the amplitude of the LTS is a monotonically increasing, sigmoid-shape function of the hyperpolarizing current step intensity. 7. Because of the slower kinetic step of the channel's inactivation gate, our model predicts that recovery of the LTS to greater than one-half amplitude would require a prolonged hyperpolarization of greater than 100 ms (at body temperature). This imposes an upper limit (approximately 10 Hz) on the frequency of repetitive hyperpolarization that can elicit a train of LTSs and hence on the frequency of any rhythm that requires LTS-mediated bursting of thalamic neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {The signaling properties of thalamocortical (TC) neurons depend on the diversity of ion conductance mechanisms that underlie their rich membrane behavior at subthreshold potentials. Using patch-clamp recordings of TC neurons in brain slices from mice and a realistic conductance-based computational model, we characterized seven subthreshold ion currents of TC neurons and quantified their individual contributions to the total steady-state conductance at levels below tonic firing threshold. We then used the TC neuron model to show that the resting membrane potential results from the interplay of several inward and outward currents over a background provided by the potassium and sodium leak currents. The steady-state conductances of depolarizing I

	abstract = {A mathematical model of midbrain dopamine neurons has been developed to understand the mechanisms underlying two types of calcium-dependent firing patterns that these cells exhibit in vitro. The first is the regular, pacemaker-like firing exhibited in a slice preparation, and the second is a burst firing pattern sometimes exhibited in the presence of apamin. Because both types of oscillations are blocked by nifedipine, we have focused on the slow calcium dynamics underlying these firing modes. The underlying oscillations in membrane potential are best observed when action potentials are blocked by the application of TTX. This converts the regular single-spike firing mode to a slow oscillatory potential (SOP) and apamin-induced bursting to a slow square-wave oscillation. We hypothesize that the SOP results from the interplay between the L-type calcium current (I
              Ca,L
              ) and the apamin-sensitive calcium-activated potassium current ( I
              K,Ca,SK
              ). We further hypothesize that the square-wave oscillation results from the alternating voltage activation and calcium inactivation of I
              Ca,L
              . Our model consists of two components: a Hodgkin-Huxley-type membrane model and a fluid compartment model. A material balance on Ca
              2+
              is provided in the cytosolic fluid compartment, whereas calcium concentration is considered constant in the extracellular compartment. Model parameters were determined using both voltage-clamp and calcium-imaging data from the literature. In addition to modeling the SOP and square-wave oscillations in dopaminergic neurons, the model provides reasonable mimicry of the experimentally observed response of SOPs to TEA application and elongation of the plateau duration of the square-wave oscillations in response to calcium chelation.},

	abstract = {The thalamus is the primary gateway that relays sensory information to the cerebral cortex. While a single recipient cortical cell receives the convergence of many principal relay cells of the thalamus, each thalamic cell in turn integrates a dense and distributed synaptic feedback from the cortex. During sensory processing, the influence of this functional loop remains largely ignored. Using dynamic-clamp techniques in thalamic slices in vitro, we combined theoretical and experimental approaches to implement a realistic hybrid retino-thalamo-cortical pathway mixing biological cells and simulated circuits. The synaptic bombardment of cortical origin was mimicked through the injection of a stochastic mixture of excitatory and inhibitory conductances, resulting in a gradable correlation level of afferent activity shared by thalamic cells. The study of the impact of the simulated cortical input on the global retinocortical signal transfer efficiency revealed a novel control mechanism resulting from the collective resonance of all thalamic relay neurons. We show here that the transfer efficiency of sensory input transmission depends on three key features: i) the number of thalamocortical cells involved in the many-toone convergence from thalamus to cortex, ii) the statistics of the corticothalamic synaptic bombardment and iii) the level of correlation imposed between converging thalamic relay cells. In particular, our results demonstrate counterintuitively that the retinocortical signal transfer efficiency increases when the level of correlation across thalamic cells decreases. This suggests that the transfer efficiency of relay cells could be selectively amplified when they become simultaneously desynchronized by the cortical feedback. When applied to the intact brain, this network regulation mechanism could direct an attentional focus to specific thalamic subassemblies and select the appropriate input lines to the cortex according to the descending influence of cortically-defined ‘‘priors’’.},

	abstract = {Low voltage-activated (LVA) T-type calcium channels are well regarded as a key mechanism underlying the generation of neuronal burst-ﬁring. Their low threshold for activation combined with a rapid and transient calcium conductance generates low-threshold calcium potentials (LTCPs), upon the crest of which high frequency action potentials ﬁre for a brief period. Experiments using simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and intracellular recordings demonstrate that neuronal burst-ﬁring is a likely causative component in the generation of normal sleep patterns as well as some pathophysiological conditions, such as epileptic seizures. However, less is known as to how these neuronal bursts impact brain behavior, in particular network synchronization. In this review we summarize recent ﬁndings concerning the role of T-type calcium channels in burst-ﬁring and discuss how they likely contribute to the generation of network synchrony. We further outline the function of burst-ﬁring and network synchrony in terms of epileptic seizures. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Calcium channels. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Synchronization behaviors of bursting neurons coupled through electrical and dynamic chemical synapses are investigated. The Izhikevich model is used with random and small world network of bursting neurons. Various currents which consist of diffusive electrical and time-delayed dynamic chemical synapses are used in the simulations to investigate the influences of synaptic currents and couplings on synchronization behavior of bursting neurons. The effects of parameters, such as time delay, inhibitory synaptic strengths, and decay time on synchronization behavior are investigated. It is observed that in random networks with no delay, bursting synchrony is established with the electrical synapse alone, single spiking synchrony is observed with hybrid coupling. In small world network with no delay, periodic bursting behavior with multiple spikes is observed when only chemical and only electrical synapse exist. Single-spike and multiple-spike bursting are established with hybrid couplings. A decrease in the synchronization measure is observed with zero time delay, as the decay time is increased in random network. For synaptic delays which are above active phase period, synchronization measure increases with an increase in synaptic strength and time delay in small world network. However, in random network, it increases with only an increase in synaptic strength.},

We investigated activation properties of this spike in relay cells of the cat’s lateral geniculate nucleus using the combined approach of current-clamp intracellular recording from thalamic slices and simulations with a reduced model based on voltage-clamp data. Our experimental data from 42 relay cells showed that the actual Ca

              spike of nearly invariant amplitude when suprathreshold. The transition between the ohmic response and activated Ca
              2+
              spikes was abrupt and reflected a difference in depolarizing inputs of {\textless}1 mV. However, activation of a full-blown Ca
              2+

              spike became less with stronger activating inputs because a stronger input produced a stronger depolarization that reached the critical membrane potential earlier. Although Ca
              2+
              spikes were activated in a nearly all-or-none manner from a given holding potential, their actual amplitudes were related to these holding potentials, which, in turn, determined the level of I

              , which is known to delay firing in many cells, does not seem to contribute to the variable latency seen in activation of Ca
              2+
              spikes. Instead the simulations indicate that the activation of I
              T
              starts initially with a slow and graded depolarization until enough of the underling transient (or T) Ca
              2+
              channels are recruited to produce a fast, “autocatalytic” depolarization seen as the Ca

              spike. This can produce variable latency dependent on the strength of the initial activation of T channels. The nearly all-or-none nature of Ca

              spike activation suggests that when a burst of action potentials normally is evoked as a result of a Ca
              2+

This top-down projection may allow the cortex to regulate sensory processing by modulating the excitability of thalamic cells. Layer 6 corticothalamic neurons monosynaptically excite thalamocortical cells, but also indirectly inhibit them by driving inhibitory cells of the thalamic reticular nucleus. Whether corticothalamic activity generally suppresses or excites the thalamus remains unclear. Here we show that the corticothalamic inﬂuence is dynamic, with the excitatory-inhibitory balance shifting in an activity-dependent fashion. During lowfrequency activity, corticothalamic effects are mainly suppressive, whereas higher-frequency activity (even a short bout of gamma frequency oscillations) converts the corticothalamic inﬂuence to enhancement. The mechanism of this switching depends on distinct forms of short-term synaptic plasticity across multiple corticothalamic circuit components. Our results reveal an activity-dependent mechanism by which corticothalamic neurons can bidirectionally switch the excitability and sensory throughput of the thalamus, possibly to meet changing behavioral demands.},

Neurophysiol. 79: 999–1016, 1998. Early studies have shown that spindle oscillations are generated in the thalamus and are synchronized over wide cortical territories. More recent experiments have shown that this large-scale synchrony depends on the integrity of corticothalamic feedback. Previously proposed mechanisms emphasized exclusively intrathalamic mechanisms to generate the synchrony of these oscillations. In the present paper, we propose a cellular mechanism in which the synchrony is dependent of a mutual interaction between cortex and thalamus. This cellular mechanism is tested by computational models consisting of pyramidal cells, interneurons, thalamic reticular (RE) and thalamocortical (TC) relay cells, on the basis of voltage-clamp data on intrinsic currents and synaptic receptors present in the circuitry. The model suggests that corticothalamic feedback must operate on the thalamus mainly through excitation of GABAergic RE neurons, therefore recruiting relay cells essentially through inhibition and rebound. We provide experimental evidence for such dominant inhibition in the lateral posterior nucleus. In these conditions, the model shows that cortical discharges optimally evoked thalamic oscillations. This feature is essential to the present cellular mechanism and is also consistently observed experimentally. The model further shows that, with this type of corticothalamic feedback, cortical discharges recruited large areas of the thalamus because of the divergent cortex-to-RE and RE-to-TC axonal projections. Consequently, the thalamocortical network generated patterns of oscillations and synchrony similar to in vivo recordings. The model also emphasizes the important role of the modulation of the I
              h
              current by calcium in TC cells. This property conferred a relative refractoriness to the entire network, a feature also observed experimentally, as we show here. Further, the same property accounted for various spatiotemporal features of oscillations, such as systematic propagation after low-intensity cortical stimulation, local oscillations, and more generally, a high variability in the patterns of spontaneous oscillations, similar to in vivo recordings. We propose that the large-scale synchrony of spindle oscillations in vivo is the result of thalamocortical interactions in which the corticothalamic feedback acts predominantly through the RE nucleus. Several predictions are suggested to test the validity of this model.},

	abstract = {Thalamic neurons have been long assumed to ﬁre in tonic mode during perceptive states, and in burst mode during sleep and unconsciousness. However, recent evidence suggests that bursts may also be relevant in the encoding of sensory information. Here, we explore the neural code of such thalamic bursts. In order to assess whether the burst code is generic or whether it depends on the detailed properties of each bursting neuron, we analyzed two neuron models incorporating different levels of biological detail. One of the models contained no information of the biophysical processes entailed in spike generation, and described neuron activity at a phenomenological level. The second model represented the evolution of the individual ionic conductances involved in spiking and bursting, and required a large number of parameters. We analyzed the models’ input selectivity using reverse correlation methods and information theory. We found that n-spike bursts from both models transmit information by modulating their spike count in response to changes to instantaneous input features, such as slope, phase, amplitude, etc. The stimulus feature that is most efﬁciently encoded by bursts, however, need not coincide with one of such classical features. We therefore searched for the optimal feature among all those that could be expressed as a linear transformation of the time-dependent input current. We found that bursting neurons transmitted 6 times more information about such more general features. The relevant events in the stimulus were located in a time window spanning ∼ 100 ms before and ∼ 20 ms after burst onset. Most importantly, the neural code employed by the simple and the biologically realistic models was largely the same, implying that the simple thalamic neuron model contains the essential ingredients that account for the computational properties of the thalamic burst code. Thus, our results suggest the n-spike burst code is a general property of thalamic neurons.},

The Chay model showed coexisting period-1 and period-2 bursting patterns as a parameter and initial values are varied. We simulated multiple periodic and chaotic bursting patterns with non-(NS), burst phase (BS), spike phase (SS), complete (CS), and lag synchronization states. When the coexisting behavior is near period-2 bursting, the transitions of synchronization states of the coupled system follows very complex transitions that begins with transitions between BS and SS, moves to transitions between CS and SS, and to CS. Most initial values lead to the CS state of period-2 bursting while only a few lead to the CS state of period-1 bursting. When the coexisting behavior is near period-1 bursting, the transitions begin with NS, move to transitions between SS and BS, to transitions between SS and CS, and then to CS. Most initial values lead to the CS state of period-1 bursting but a few lead to the CS state of period-2 bursting. The BS was identiﬁed as chaos synchronization. The patterns for NS and transitions between BS and SS are insensitive to initial values. The patterns for transitions between CS and SS and the CS state are sensitive to them. The number of spikes per burst of non-CS bursting increases with increasing coupling strength. These results not only reveal the initial value- and parameterdependent synchronization transitions of coupled systems with coexisting behaviors, but also facilitate interpretation of various bursting patterns and synchronization transitions generated in the nervous system with weak coupling strength.},

	abstract = {GABAergic interneurons (INs) in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) shape the information flow from retina to cortex, presumably by controlling the number of visually evoked spikes in geniculate thalamocortical (TC) neurons, and refining their receptive field. The INs exhibit a rich variety of firing patterns: Depolarizing current injections to the soma may induce tonic firing, periodic bursting or an initial burst followed by tonic spiking, sometimes with prominent spike-time adaptation. When released from hyperpolarization, some INs elicit rebound bursts, while others return more passively to the resting potential. A full mechanistic understanding that explains the function of the dLGN on the basis of neuronal morphology, physiology and circuitry is currently lacking. One way to approach such an understanding is by developing a detailed mathematical model of the involved cells and their interactions. Limitations of the previous models for the INs of the dLGN region prevent an accurate representation of the conceptual framework needed to understand the computational properties of this region. We here present a detailed compartmental model of INs using, for the first time, a morphological reconstruction and a set of active dendritic conductances constrained by experimental somatic recordings from INs under several different current-clamp conditions. The model makes a number of experimentally testable predictions about the role of specific mechanisms for the firing properties observed in these neurons. In addition to accounting for the significant features of all experimental traces, it quantitatively reproduces the experimental recordings of the action-potential- firing frequency as a function of injected current. We show how and why relative differences in conductance values, rather than differences in ion channel composition, could account for the distinct differences between the responses observed in two different neurons, suggesting that INs may be individually tuned to optimize network operation under different input conditions.},

	abstract = {Directional selectivity, in which neurons respond strongly to an object moving in a given direction (“preferred”) but respond weakly or not at all to an object moving in the opposite direction (“null”), is a critical computation achieved in brain circuits. Previous measures of direction selectivity have compared the numbers of action potentials elicited by each direction of movement, but most sensory neurons display patterning, such as bursting, in their spike trains. To examine the contribution of patterned responses to direction selectivity, we recorded from midbrain neurons in weakly electric fish and found that most neurons responded with a combination of both bursts and isolated spikes to moving object stimuli. In these neurons, we separated bursts and isolated spikes using an interspike interval (ISI) threshold. The directional bias of bursts was significantly higher than that of either the full spike train or the isolated spike train. To examine the encoding and decoding of bursts, we built biologically plausible models that examine 1) the upstream mechanisms that generate these spiking patterns and 2) downstream decoders of bursts. Our model of upstream mechanisms uses an interaction between afferent input and subthreshold calcium channels to give rise to burst firing that occurs preferentially for one direction of movement. We tested this model in vivo by application of calcium antagonists, which reduced burst firing and eliminated the differences in direction selectivity between bursts, isolated spikes, and the full spike train. Our model of downstream decoders used strong synaptic facilitation to achieve qualitatively similar results to those obtained using the ISI threshold criterion. This model shows that direction selective information carried by bursts can be decoded by downstream neurons using biophysically plausible mechanisms.},

	abstract = {When the brain goes from wakefulness to sleep, cortical neurons begin to undergo slow oscillations in their membrane potential that are synchronized by thalamocortical circuits and reflected in EEG slow waves. In order to provide a self-consistent account of the transition from wakefulness to sleep and of the generation of sleep slow waves, we have constructed a largescale computer model that encompasses portions of two visual areas and associated thalamic and reticular thalamic nuclei. Thousands of model neurons, incorporating several intrinsic currents, are interconnected with millions of thalamocortical, corticothalamic, intra- and inter-areal corticocortical connections. In the waking mode, the model exhibits irregular spontaneous firing and selective responses to visual stimuli. In the sleep mode, neuromodulatory changes lead to slow oscillations that closely resemble those observed in vivo and in vitro. A systematic exploration of the effects of intrinsic currents and network parameters on the initiation, maintenance and termination of slow oscillations shows the following: 1. An increase in potassium leak conductances is sufficient to trigger the transition from wakefulness to sleep. 2. The activation of persistent sodium currents is sufficient to initiate the up-state of the slow oscillation. 3. A combination of intrinsic and synaptic currents is sufficient to maintain the upstate. 4. Depolarization-activated potassium currents and synaptic depression terminate the upstate. 5. Corticocortical connections synchronize the slow oscillation. The model is the first to integrate intrinsic neuronal properties with detailed thalamocortical anatomy and reproduce neural activity patterns in both wakefulness and sleep, thereby providing a powerful tool to investigate the role of sleep in information transmission and plasticity.},

A wide variety of neuronal models have been studied from different viewpoints. The digital spiking silicon neuron (DSSN) model is a qualitative model that focuses on efﬁcient implementation by digital arithmetic circuits. We expanded the DSSN model and found appropriate parameter sets with which it reproduces the dynamical behaviors of the ionic-conductance models of four classes of cortical and thalamic neurons. We ﬁrst developed a four-variable model by reducing the number of variables in the ionic-conductance models and elucidated its mathematical structures using bifurcation analysis. Then, expanded DSSN models were constructed that reproduce these mathematical structures and capture the characteristic behavior of each neuron class. We conﬁrmed that statistics of the neuronal spike sequences are similar in the DSSN and the ionic-conductance models. Computational cost of the DSSN model is larger than that of the recent sophisticated Integrate-and-Fire-based models, but smaller than the ionic-conductance models. This model is intended to provide another meeting point for above trade-off that satisﬁes the demand for large-scale neuronal network simulation with closer-to-biology models.},

The complex interplay of ionic conductances within the thalamo-reticular-cortical network give rise to these multiple modes of activity and a rapid transition exists between these modes. To better understand this transition, we constructed a simpliﬁed computational model based on physiological recordings and physiologically realistic parameters of a three-neuron network containing a thalamocortical cell, a thalamic reticular neuron, and a corticothalamic cell. The network can assume multiple states of oscillatory activity, resembling sleep, wakefulness, and the transition between these two. We found that during the transition period, but not during other states, thalamic and cortical neurons displayed chaotic dynamics, based on the presence of strange attractors, estimation of positive Lyapunov exponents and the presence of a fractal dimension in the spike trains. These dynamics were quantitatively dependent on certain features of the network, such as the presence of corticothalamic feedback and the strength of inhibition between the thalamic reticular nucleus and thalamocortical neurons. These data suggest that chaotic dynamics facilitate a rapid transition between sleep and wakefulness and produce a series of experimentally testable predictions to further investigate the events occurring during the sleep-wake transition period.},

Neurophysiol. 77: 1994–2006, 1997. The general objectives of our research, presented in this series of papers, were to develop a computational model of the brain stem respiratory neural network and to explore possible neural mechanisms that provide the genesis of respiratory oscillations and the specific firing patterns of respiratory neurons. The present paper describes models of single respiratory neurons that have been used as the elements in our network models of the central respiratory pattern generator presented in subsequent papers. The models of respiratory neurons were developed in the Hodgkin-Huxley style employing both physiological and biophysical data obtained from brain stem neurons in mammals. Two single respiratory neuron models were developed to match the two distinct firing behaviors of respiratory neurons described in vivo: neuron type I shows an adapting firing pattern in response to synaptic excitation, and neuron type II shows a ramp firing pattern during membrane depolarization after a period of synaptic inhibition. We found that a frequency ramp firing pattern can result from intrinsic membrane properties, specifically from the combined influence of calcium-dependent K
              AHP
              (Ca), low-threshold Ca
              T
              and K
              A
              channels. The neuron models with these ionic channels (type II) demonstrated ramp firing patterns similar to those recorded from respiratory neurons in vivo. Our simulations show that K
              AHP
              (Ca) channels in combination with high-threshold Ca
              L
              channels produce spike frequency adaptation during synaptic excitation. However, in combination with low-threshold Ca
              T
              channels, they cause a frequency ramp firing response after release from inhibition. This promotes a testable hypothesis that the main difference between the respiratory neurons that adapt (for example, early inspiratory, postinspiratory, and decrementing expiratory) and those that show ramp firing patterns (for example, ramp inspiratory and augmenting expiratory) consists of a ratio between the two types of calcium channels: Ca
              L
              channels predominate in the former and Ca
              T
              channels in the latter respiratory neuron types. We have analyzed the dependence of adapting and ramp firing patterns on maximal conductances of different ionic channels and values of synaptic drive. The effect of adjusting specific membrane conductances and synaptic interactions revealed plausible neuronal mechanisms that may underlie modulatory effects on respiratory neuron firing patterns and network performances. The results of computer simulation provide useful insight into functional significance of specific intrinsic membrane properties and their interactions with phasic synaptic inputs for a better understanding of respiratory neuron firing behavior.},

	abstract = {The dorsal column nuclei, cuneatus and gracilis, play a fundamental role in the processing and integration of somesthetic ascending information. Intracellular and patch-clamp recordings obtained in cat in vivo have shown that cuneothalamic projection neurons present two modes of activity: oscillatory and tonic (Canedo et al 1998 Neuroscience 84 603–17). The former is the basis of generating, in sleep and anaesthetized states, slow, delta and spindle rhythms under the control of the cerebral cortex (Marin˜o et al 2000 Neuroscience 95 657–73). The latter is needed, during wakefulness, to process somesthetic information in real time. To study this behaviour we have developed the ﬁrst realistic computational model of the cuneothalamic projection neurons. The modelling was guided by experimental recordings, which suggest the existence of hyperpolarization-activated inward currents, transient low- and high-threshold calcium currents, and calcium-activated potassium currents. The neuronal responses were simulated during (1) sleep, (2) transition from sleep to wakefulness and (3) wakefulness under both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input. In wakefulness the model predicts a set of synaptically driven ﬁring modes that could be associated with information processing strategies in the middle cuneate nucleus.},

We measured responses during both tonic and burst firing modes to sinusoidal current injection and performed Fourier analysis on these responses. For comparison, we constructed a minimal “integrate-and-fire-or-burst” (IFB) neuron model that reproduces salient features of the relay cell responses. The IFB model is constrained to quantitatively fit our Fourier analysis of experimental relay neuron responses, including: the temporal tuning of the response in both tonic and burst modes, including a finding of low-pass and sometimes broadband behavior of tonic firing and band-pass characteristics during bursting, and the generally greater linearity of tonic compared with burst responses at low frequencies. In tonic mode, both experimental and theoretical responses display a frequency-dependent transition from massively superharmonic spiking to phase-locked superharmonic spiking near 3 Hz, followed by phase-locked subharmonic spiking at higher frequencies. Subharmonic and superharmonic burst responses also were observed experimentally. Characterizing the response properties of the “tuned” IFB model leads to insights regarding the observed stimulus dependence of burst versus tonic response mode in relay neurons. Furthermore the simplicity of the IFB model makes it a candidate for large scale network simulations of thalamic functioning.},

	abstract = {In a systematic study of thalamocortical relay neuron responses to sinusoidal current injection [J. Neurophysiol. 83 (1), 588], we found that the Fourier fundamental of tonic responses was regularly phase advanced during low temporal frequency stimulation (1/10 cycle at 0.1 Hz). We hypothesized that such phase advances of the Fourier fundamental response were due to a slow spike-frequency adaptation. Here we measure the time-dependence of the instantaneous ﬁring rate during a current pulse protocol, conﬁrm the presence of a slow spike-frequency adaptation, and quantify the adaptation time constant (0.6–2.0 s) and percentage adaptation of spike rate (40–60\%). In light of these results, we augment a previously reported minimal integrate-and-ﬁre-or-burst (IFB) neuron model with an adaptation current. When the parameters for this current are ﬁt using a quantitative theory of spike-frequency adaptation [J. Neurophysiol. 79, 1549], the IFB model reproduces the experimentally observed phase advance of the Fourier fundamental response during sinusoidal current injection. Using fast-slow variable analysis, we develop a ﬁring-rate reduction of the IFB model and perform parameter studies to investigate the dependence of the Fourier fundamental response (amplitude and phase) on the maximum conductance and recovery time constant for the adaptation current. Analytical calculations clarify the relationship between dc and ac measures of the suppression of response due to spike-frequency adaptation, show how the latter depends on stimulation frequency, and conﬁrm the adaptation-induced phase advance of the Fourier fundamental observed in both experiment and simulation. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {In recent experiments, synaptically isolated neurons from rat cortical culture, were stimulated with periodic extracellular ﬁxed-amplitude current pulses for extended durations of days. The neuron’s response depended on its own history, as well as on the history of the input, and was classiﬁed into several modes. Interestingly, in one of the modes the neuron behaved intermittently, exhibiting irregular ﬁring patterns changing in a complex and variable manner over the entire range of experimental timescales, from seconds to days. With the aim of developing a minimal biophysical explanation for these results, we propose a general scheme, that, given a few assumptions (mainly, a timescale separation in kinetics) closely describes the response of deterministic conductance-based neuron models under pulse stimulation, using a discrete time piecewise linear mapping, which is amenable to detailed mathematical analysis. Using this method we reproduce the basic modes exhibited by the neuron experimentally, as well as the mean response in each mode. Speciﬁcally, we derive precise closed-form input-output expressions for the transient timescale and ﬁring rates, which are expressed in terms of experimentally measurable variables, and conform with the experimental results. However, the mathematical analysis shows that the resulting ﬁring patterns in these deterministic models are always regular and repeatable (i.e., no chaos), in contrast to the irregular and variable behavior displayed by the neuron in certain regimes. This fact, and the sensitive near-threshold dynamics of the model, indicate that intrinsic ion channel noise has a signiﬁcant impact on the neuronal response, and may help reproduce the experimentally observed variability, as we also demonstrate numerically. In a companion paper, we extend our analysis to stochastic conductance-based models, and show how these can be used to reproduce the details of the observed irregular and variable neuronal response.},

	abstract = {To better understand population phenomena in thalamocortical neuronal ensembles, we have constructed a preliminary network model with 3,560 multicompartment neurons (containing soma, branching dendrites, and a portion of axon). Types of neurons included superficial pyramids (with regular spiking [RS] and fast rhythmic bursting [FRB] firing behaviors); RS spiny stellates; fast spiking (FS) interneurons, with basket-type and axoaxonic types of connectivity, and located in superficial and deep cortical layers; low threshold spiking (LTS) interneurons, which contacted principal cell dendrites; deep pyramids, which could have RS or intrinsic bursting (IB) firing behaviors, and endowed either with nontufted apical dendrites or with long tufted apical dendrites; thalamocortical relay (TCR) cells; and nucleus reticularis (nRT) cells. To the extent possible, both electrophysiology and synaptic connectivity were based on published data, although many arbitrary choices were necessary. In addition to synaptic connectivity (by AMPA/kainate, NMDA, and GABA
              A
              receptors), we also included electrical coupling between dendrites of interneurons, nRT cells, and TCR cells, and—in various combinations—electrical coupling between the proximal axons of certain cortical principal neurons. Our network model replicates several observed population phenomena, including 1) persistent gamma oscillations; 2) thalamocortical sleep spindles; 3) series of synchronized population bursts, resembling electrographic seizures; 4) isolated double population bursts with superimposed very fast oscillations ({\textgreater}100 Hz, “VFO”); 5) spike-wave, polyspike-wave, and fast runs (about 10 Hz). We show that epileptiform bursts, including double and multiple bursts, containing VFO occur in rat auditory cortex in vitro, in the presence of kainate, when both GABA
              A
              and GABA
              B
              receptors are blocked. Electrical coupling between axons appears necessary (as reported previously) for persistent gamma and additionally plays a role in the detailed shaping of epileptogenic events. The degree of recurrent synaptic excitation between spiny stellate cells, and their tendency to fire throughout multiple bursts, also appears critical in shaping epileptogenic events.},

	abstract = {We consider here a single-compartment model of these neurons which is capable of describing many of the known features of spike generation, particularly the slow rhythmic pacemaking activity often observed in these cells in a variety of species. Included in the model are ten kinds of voltage dependent ion channels as well as calcium-dependent potassium current. Calcium dynamics includes buffering and pumping. In sections 3-9, each component is considered in detail and parameters estimated from voltage clamp data where possible. In the next two sections simplified versions of some components are employed to explore the effects of various parameters on spiking, using a systematic approach, ending up with the following eleven components: a fast sodium current \$I\_\{Na\}\$, a delayed rectifier potassium current \$I\_\{KDR\}\$, a transient potassium current \$I\_A\$, a low-threshold calcium current \$I\_T\$, two high threshold calcium currents \$I\_L\$ and \$I\_N\$, small and large conductance potassium currents \$I\_\{SK\}\$ and \$I\_\{BK\}\$, a hyperpolarization-activated cation current \$I\_H\$, a leak current \$I\_\{Leak\}\$ and intracellular calcium ion concentration \$Ca\_i\$. Attention is focused on the properties usually associated with these neurons, particularly long duration of action potential, pacemaker-like spiking and the ramp-like return to threshold after a spike. In some cases the membrane potential trajectories display doublets or have kinks or notches as have been reported in some experimental studies. The computed time courses of \$I\_A\$ and \$I\_T\$ during the interspike interval support the generally held view of a competition between them in influencing the frequency of spiking. Spontaneous spiking could be obtained with small changes in a few parameters from their values with driven spiking.},

	abstract = {Synchronous rhythms represent a core mechanism for sculpting temporal coordination of neural activity in the brainwide network. This review focuses on oscillations in the cerebral cortex that occur during cognition, in alert behaving conditions. Over the last two decades, experimental and modeling work has made great strides in elucidating the detailed cellular and circuit basis of these rhythms, particularly gamma and theta rhythms. The underlying physiological mechanisms are diverse (ranging from resonance and pacemaker properties of single cells, to multiple scenarios for population synchronization and wave propagation), but also exhibit unifying principles. A major conceptual advance was the realization that synaptic inhibition plays a fundamental role in rhythmogenesis, either in an interneuronal network or in a recipropocal excitatory-inhibitory loop. Computational functions of synchronous oscillations in cognition are still a matter of debate among systems neuroscientists, in part because the notion of regular oscillation seems to contradict the common observation that spiking discharges of individual neurons in the cortex are highly stochastic and far from being clock-like. However, recent findings have led to a framework that goes beyond the conventional theory of coupled oscillators, and reconciles the apparent dichotomy between irregular single neuron activity and field potential oscillations. From this perspective, a plethora of studies will be reviewed on the involvement of long-distance neuronal coherence in cognitive functions such as multisensory integration, working memory and selective attention. Finally, implications of abnormal neural synchronization are discussed as they relate to mental disorders like schizophrenia and autism.},

	abstract = {Relay neurons in dorsal thalamic nuclei can fire high frequency bursts of action potentials that ride the crest of voltage-dependent transient (T-type) calcium currents (low threshold spike; LTS). To explore potential nucleus-specific burst features, we compared the membrane properties of dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and pulvinar nucleus relay neurons using in vitro whole cell recording in juvenile and adult tree shrew (Tupaia) tissue slices. We injected current ramps of variable slope into neurons that were sufficiently hyperpolarized to de-inactivate T-type calcium channels. In a small percentage of juvenile pulvinar and dLGN neurons, an LTS could not be evoked. In the remaining juvenile neurons, and in all adult dLGN neurons, a single LTS could be evoked by current ramps. However, in the adult pulvinar, current ramps evoked multiple LTSs in over 70\% of recorded neurons. Using immunohistochemistry, western blot techniques, unbiased stereology, confocal and electron microscopy, we found that pulvinar neurons expressed more Ttype calcium channels (Cav 3.2) and more small conductance potassium channels (SK2) than dLGN neurons and that the pulvinar nucleus contained a higher glia-to-neuron ratio than the dLGN. Hodgkin-Huxley type compartmental models revealed that the distinct firing modes could be replicated by manipulating T-type calcium and SK2 channel density, distribution, and kinetics. The intrinsic properties of pulvinar neurons that promote burst firing in the adult may be relevant to the treatment of conditions that involve the adult onset of aberrant thalamocortical interactions.},

We investigated activation properties of this spike in relay cells of the cat’s lateral geniculate nucleus using the combined approach of current-clamp intracellular recording from thalamic slices and simulations with a reduced model based on voltage-clamp data. Our experimental data from 42 relay cells showed that the actual Ca

              2+
              spike of nearly invariant amplitude when suprathreshold. The transition between the ohmic response and activated Ca
              2+
              spikes was abrupt and reflected a difference in depolarizing inputs of {\textless}1 mV. However, activation of a full-blown Ca
              2+
              spike was preceded by a slower period of depolarization that was graded with the amplitude of current injection, and the full-blown Ca
              2+
              spike activated when this slower depolarization reached a sufficient membrane potential, a quasithreshold. As a result, the latency of the evoked Ca
              2+
              spike became less with stronger activating inputs because a stronger input produced a stronger depolarization that reached the critical membrane potential earlier. Although Ca
              2+
              spikes were activated in a nearly all-or-none manner from a given holding potential, their actual amplitudes were related to these holding potentials, which, in turn, determined the level of I

              conductance underlying I
              A
              , which is known to delay firing in many cells, does not seem to contribute to the variable latency seen in activation of Ca
              2+
              spikes. Instead the simulations indicate that the activation of I
              T
              starts initially with a slow and graded depolarization until enough of the underling transient (or T) Ca
              2+
              channels are recruited to produce a fast, “autocatalytic” depolarization seen as the Ca
              2+
              spike. This can produce variable latency dependent on the strength of the initial activation of T channels. The nearly all-or-none nature of Ca
              2+
              spike activation suggests that when a burst of action potentials normally is evoked as a result of a Ca
              2+
              spike and transmitted to cortex, this signal is largely invariant with the amplitude of the input activating the relay cell.},

Input impedance with this technique (607.0 {\textasciicircum} 222.4 MV) was far larger than that measured with sharp electrode techniques, suggesting that interneurons may be more electrotonically compact than previously believed. Consistent and robust burst ﬁring was observed in all interneurons when a slight depolarizing boost was given from a potential at, or slightly hyperpolarized from, resting membrane potential. These bursts had some similarities to the low-threshold spike described previously in other thalamic neuron types. The bursting responses were blocked by Niϩ, suggesting that the lowthreshold calcium current IT, responsible for the low-threshold spike, was also involved in interneuron burst ﬁring. Compared to the low-threshold spike of thalamocortical cells, however, the interneuron bursts were of relatively long duration and low intraburst frequency. The requirement for a depolarizing boost to elicit the burst is consistent with previous reports of a depolarizing shift of the IT activation curve of interneurons relative to thalamocortical cells, a ﬁnding we conﬁrmed using voltage-clamp. Voltage-clamp study also revealed an additional long-lasting current that could be tentatively identiﬁed as the calcium activated non-selective cation current, ICAN, based on reversal potential and on pharmacological characteristics. Computer simulation of the interneuron burst demonstrated that its particular morphology is likely due to the interaction of IT and ICAN. In the slice, bursts could also be elicited by stimulation of the optic tract, suggesting that they may occur in response to natural stimulation. Synaptically triggered bursts were only partially blocked by Niϩ, but could then be completely blocked by further addition of ({\textasciicircum})-2amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid. The existence of robust bursts in this cell type suggests an additional role for interneurons in sculpting sensory responses by feedforward inhibition of thalamocortical cells.},

All these processes target neuron intrinsic properties and connectivity to achieve specific physiological goals, raising the question of how they can operate without interfering with each other. Here, we highlight the central importance of a timescale separation in the activation of sodium and T-type calcium channels to sustain robust switches in brain states in thalamic neurons that are compatible with synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation. We quantify the role of this timescale separation by comparing the robustness of rhythms of six published conductance-based models at the cellular, circuit and network levels. We show that robust rhythm generation requires a T-type calcium channel activation whose kinetics are situated between sodium channel activation and T-type calcium channel inactivation in all models despite their quantitative differences.},

	abstract = {Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is under neuromodulatory control, which is correlated with distinct behavioral states. Previously, we reported that dopamine, a reward signal, broadens the time window for synaptic potentiation and modulates the outcome of hippocampal STDP even when applied after the plasticity induction protocol (Brzosko et al., 2015). Here, we demonstrate that sequential neuromodulation of STDP by acetylcholine and dopamine offers an efficacious model of reward-based navigation. Specifically, our experimental data in mouse hippocampal slices show that acetylcholine biases STDP toward synaptic depression, whilst subsequent application of dopamine converts this depression into potentiation. Incorporating this bidirectional neuromodulation-enabled correlational synaptic learning rule into a computational model yields effective navigation toward changing reward locations, as in natural foraging behavior. Thus, temporally sequenced neuromodulation of STDP enables associations to be made between actions and outcomes and also provides a possible mechanism for aligning the time scales of cellular and behavioral learning.},

Here we show that the modulation of STDP by a global reward signal leads to reinforcement learning. We first derive analytically learning rules involving reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent synaptic and intrinsic plasticity, by applying a reinforcement learning algorithm to the stochastic spike response model of spiking neurons. These rules have several features common to plasticity mechanisms experimentally found in the brain. We then demonstrate in simulations of networks of integrate-and-fire neurons the efficacy of two simple learning rules involving modulated STDP. One rule is a direct extension of the standard STDP model (modulated STDP), and the other one involves an eligibility trace stored at each synapse that keeps a decaying memory of the relationships between the recent pairs of pre- and postsynaptic spike pairs (modulated STDP with eligibility trace). This latter rule permits learning even if the reward signal is delayed. The proposed rules are able to solve the XOR problem with both rate coded and temporally coded input and to learn a target output firing-rate pattern. These learning rules are biologically plausible, may be used for training generic artificial spiking neural networks, regardless of the neural model used, and suggest the experimental investigation in animals of the existence of reward-modulated STDP.},

	abstract = {Synaptic plasticity is important for learning and memory. With increasing evidence linking sleep states to changes in synaptic strength, an emerging view is that sleep promotes learning and memory by facilitating experience-induced synaptic plasticity. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on the function of sleep in regulating cortical synaptic plasticity. Specifically, we outline the electroencephalogram signatures of sleep states (e.g. slow-wave sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, spindles), sleep state-dependent changes in gene and synaptic protein expression, synaptic morphology, and neuronal and network activity. We highlight studies showing that post-experience sleep potentiates experience-induced synaptic changes and discuss the potential mechanisms that may link sleep-related brain activity to synaptic structural remodelling. We conclude that both synapse formation or strengthening and elimination or weakening occur across sleep. This sleep-dependent synaptic plasticity plays an important role in neuronal circuit refinement during development and after learning, while sleep disorders may contribute to or exacerbate the development of common neurological diseases.

	abstract = {Most reinforcement learning models assume that the reward signal arrives after the activity that led to the reward, placing constraints on the possible underlying cellular mechanisms. Here we show that dopamine, a positive reinforcement signal, can retroactively convert hippocampal timing-dependent synaptic depression into potentiation. This effect requires functional NMDA receptors and is mediated in part through the activation of the cAMP/PKA cascade. Collectively, our results support the idea that reward-related signaling can act on a pre-established synaptic eligibility trace, thereby associating specific experiences with behaviorally distant, rewarding outcomes. This finding identifies a biologically plausible mechanism for solving the ‘distal reward problem’.
          , 
            To help someone learn a new task, we might give them a reward after they have performed well. However, these rewards tend to be given several seconds or minutes after the behavior they are supposed to promote. Therefore, it is unclear how the rewards affect the brain and help accelerate the learning process.
            Information is processed and sent around the brain by networks of cells called neurons. These networks are constantly remodeled because learning changes the connections—called synapses—that neighboring neurons signal across. Synapses can be strengthened so that signals are sent across them more easily in the future. Synapses can also be weakened, making it harder for the neurons to subsequently communicate.
            A chemical called dopamine is often produced in the brain when a reward is received. If dopamine is present in a synapse whilst a neuron is signaling to its neighbor, it can affect how effectively this communication occurs. Brzosko et al. have now investigated whether dopamine can also change the synapses if it is applied after signaling has already happened.
            The strengthening or weakening of synapses can be triggered by electrically stimulating the neurons on either side of a synapse at particular times. Brzosko et al. did this to neurons in slices of mouse brain, and then applied dopamine to the neurons. The results suggest that dopamine can reverse synaptic weakening and can even cause the synapses to strengthen. However, the dopamine had to be applied immediately after stimulation to be able to strengthen the synapse. The next challenge is to establish whether this change in synaptic strength is responsible for the change in behavior.},

	abstract = {To survive, animals have to quickly modify their behaviour when the reward changes. The internal representations responsible for this are updated through synaptic weight changes, mediated by certain neuromodulators conveying feedback from the environment. In previous experiments, we discovered a form of hippocampal Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity (STDP) that is sequentially modulated by acetylcholine and dopamine. Acetylcholine facilitates synaptic depression, while dopamine retroactively converts the depression into potentiation. When these experimental findings were implemented as a learning rule in a computational model, our simulations showed that cholinergic-facilitated depression is important for reversal learning. In the present study, we tested the model’s prediction by optogenetically inactivating cholinergic neurons in mice during a hippocampus-dependent spatial learning task with changing rewards. We found that reversal learning, but not initial place learning, was impaired, verifying our computational prediction that acetylcholine-modulated plasticity promotes the unlearning of old reward locations. Further, differences in neuromodulator concentrations in the model captured mouse-by-mouse performance variability in the optogenetic experiments. Our line of work sheds light on how neuromodulators enable the learning of new contingencies.},

	abstract = {Synaptic plasticity is considered to be the biological substrate of learning and memory. In this document we review phenomenological models of short-term and longterm synaptic plasticity, in particular spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). The aim of the document is to provide a framework for classifying and evaluating different models of plasticity. We focus on phenomenological synaptic models that are compatible with integrate-and-ﬁre type neuron models where each neuron is described by a small number of variables. This implies that synaptic update rules for shortterm or long-term plasticity can only depend on spike timing and, potentially, on membrane potential, as well as on the value of the synaptic weight, or on low-pass ﬁltered (temporally averaged) versions of the above variables. We examine the ability of the models to account for experimental data and to fulﬁll expectations derived from theoretical considerations. We further discuss their relations to teacher-based rules (supervised learning) and reward-based rules (reinforcement learning). All models discussed in this paper are suitable for large-scale network simulations.},

	abstract = {We investigate under what conditions a neuron can learn by experimentally supported rules for spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) to predict the arrival times of strong “teacher inputs” to the same neuron. It turns out that in contrast to the famous Perceptron Convergence Theorem, which predicts convergence of the perceptron learning rule for a simpliﬁed neuron model whenever a stable solution exists, no equally strong convergence guarantee can be given for spiking neurons with STDP. But we derive a criterion on the statistical dependency structure of input spike trains which characterizes exactly when learning with STDP will converge on average for a simple model of a spiking neuron. This criterion is reminiscent of the linear separability criterion of the Perceptron Convergence Theorem, but it applies here to the rows of a correlation matrix related to the spike inputs. In addition we show through computer simulations for more realistic neuron models that the resulting analytically predicted positive learning results not only hold for the common interpretation of STDP where STDP changes the weights of synapses, but also for a more realistic interpretation suggested by experimental data where STDP modulates the initial release probability of dynamic synapses.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          The dynamics of local cortical networks are irregular, but correlated. Dynamic excitatory– inhibitory balance is a plausible mechanism that generates such irregular activity, but it remains unclear how balance is achieved and maintained in plastic neural networks. In particular, it is not fully understood how plasticity induced changes in the network affect balance, and in turn, how correlated, balanced activity impacts learning. How does the dynamics of balanced networks change under different plasticity rules? How does correlated spiking activity in recurrent networks change the evolution of weights, their eventual magnitude, and structure across the network? To address these questions, we develop a general theory of plasticity in balanced networks. We show that balance can be attained and maintained under plasticity induced weight changes. We find that correlations in the input mildly, but significantly affect the evolution of synaptic weights. Under certain plasticity rules, we find an emergence of correlations between firing rates and synaptic weights. Under these rules, synaptic weights converge to a stable manifold in weight space with their final configuration dependent on the initial state of the network. Lastly, we show that our framework can also describe the dynamics of plastic balanced networks when subsets of neurons receive targeted optogenetic input.},

	abstract = {Rats and mice use their whiskers to probe the environment. By rhythmically swiping their whiskers back and forth they can detect the existence of an object, locate it, and identify its texture. Localization can be accomplished by inferring the whisker’s position. Rhythmic neurons that track the phase of the whisking cycle encode information about the azimuthal location of the whisker. These neurons are characterized by preferred phases of firing that are narrowly distributed. Consequently, pooling the rhythmic signal from several upstream neurons is expected to result in a much narrower distribution of preferred phases in the downstream population, which however has not been observed empirically. Here, we show how spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) can provide a solution to this conundrum. We investigated the effect of STDP on the utility of a neural population to transmit rhythmic information downstream using the framework of a modeling study. We found that under a wide range of parameters, STDP facilitated the transfer of rhythmic information despite the fact that all the synaptic weights remained dynamic. As a result, the preferred phase of the downstream neuron was not fixed, but rather drifted in time at a drift velocity that depended on the preferred phase, thus inducing a distribution of preferred phases. We further analyzed how the STDP rule governs the distribution of preferred phases in the downstream population. This link between the STDP rule and the distribution of preferred phases constitutes a natural test for our theory.},

	abstract = {Experimental evidence indicates that synaptic modification depends on the timing relationship between the presynaptic inputs and the output spikes that they generate. In this letter, results are presented for models of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) whose weight dynamics is determined by a stable fixed point. Four classes of STDP are identified on the basis of the time extent of their input-output interactions. The effect on the potentiation of synapses with different rates of input is investigated to elucidate the relationship of STDP with classical studies of long-term potentiation and depression and rate-based Hebbian learning. The selective potentiation of higher-rate synaptic inputs is found only for models where the time extent of the input-output interactions is input restricted (i.e., restricted to time domains delimited by adjacent synaptic inputs) and that have a time-asymmetric learning window with a longer time constant for depression than for potentiation. The analysis provides an account of learning dynamics determined by an input-selective stable fixed point. The effect of suppressive interspike interactions on STDP is also analyzed and shown to modify the synaptic dynamics.},

	abstract = {Memory systems should be plastic to allow for learning; however, they should also retain earlier memories. Here we explore how synaptic weights and memories are retained in models of single neurons and networks equipped with spike-timing-dependent plasticity. We show that for single neuron models, the precise learning rule has a strong effect on the memory retention time. In particular, a soft-bound, weight-dependent learning rule has a very short retention time as compared with a learning rule that is independent of the synaptic weights. Next, we explore how the retention time is reflected in receptive field stability in networks. As in the single neuron case, the weight-dependent learning rule yields less stable receptive fields than a weight-independent rule. However, receptive fields stabilize in the presence of sufficient lateral inhibition, demonstrating that plasticity in networks can be regulated by inhibition and suggesting a novel role for inhibition in neural circuits.},

	abstract = {Synapses in various neural preparations exhibit spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with a variety of learning window functions. The window functions determine the magnitude and the polarity of synaptic change according to the time difference of pre- and postsynaptic spikes. Numerical experiments revealed that STDP learning with a single-expo nential window function resulted in a bimodal distribution of synaptic conductances as a consequence of competition between synapses. A slightly modified window function, however, resulted in a unimodal distribution rather than a bimodal distribution. Since various window functions have been observed in neural preparations, we develop a rigorous mathematical method to calculate the conductance distribution for any given window function. Our method is based on the Fokker-Planck equation to determine the conductance distribution and on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to characterize the membrane potential fluctuations. Demonstrating that our method reproduces the known quantitative results of STDP learning, we apply the method to the type of STDP learning found recently in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. We find that this learning can result in nearly optimized competition between synapses. Meanwhile, we find that the type of STDP learning found in the cerebellum-like structure of electric fish can result in all-or-none synapses: either all the synaptic conductances are maximized, or none of them becomes significantly large. Our method also determines the window function that optimizes synaptic competition.},

One of the most striking aspects of this plasticity mechanism is that the STDP windows display a great variety of forms in different parts of the nervous system. We explore this issue from a theoretical point of view. We choose as the optimization principle the minimization of conditional entropy or maximization of reliability in the transmission of information. We apply this principle to two types of postsynaptic dynamics, designated type I and type II. The first is characterized as being an integrator, while the second is a resonator. We find that, depending on the parameters of the models, the optimization principle can give rise to a wide variety of STDP windows, such as antisymmetric Hebbian, predominantly depressing or symmetric with one positive region and two lateral negative regions. We can relate each of these forms to the dynamical behavior of the different models. We also propose experimental tests to assess the validity of the optimization principle.},

	abstract = {Rats and mice use their whiskers to probe the environment. By rhythmically swiping their whiskers back and forth they can detect the existence of an object, locate it, and identify its texture. Localization can be accomplished by inferring the whisker’s position. Rhythmic neurons that track the phase of the whisking cycle encode information about the azimuthal location of the whisker. These neurons are characterized by preferred phases of firing that are narrowly distributed. Consequently, pooling the rhythmic signal from several upstream neurons is expected to result in a much narrower distribution of preferred phases in the downstream population, which however has not been observed empirically. Here, we show how spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) can provide a solution to this conundrum. We investigated the effect of STDP on the utility of a neural population to transmit rhythmic information downstream using the framework of a modeling study. We found that under a wide range of parameters, STDP facilitated the transfer of rhythmic information despite the fact that all the synaptic weights remained dynamic. As a result, the preferred phase of the downstream neuron was not fixed, but rather drifted in time at a drift velocity that depended on the preferred phase, thus inducing a distribution of preferred phases. We further analyzed how the STDP rule governs the distribution of preferred phases in the downstream population. This link between the STDP rule and the distribution of preferred phases constitutes a natural test for our theory.},

Recent findings indicate that there are narrow and cell type–specific temporal windows for such synaptic modification and that the generally accepted input- (or synapse-) specific rule for modification appears not to be strictly adhered to. Spike timing–dependent modifications, together with selective spread of synaptic changes, provide a set of cellular mechanisms that are likely to be important for the development and functioning of neural networks.
            When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite cell B or repeatedly or consistently takes part in firing it, some growth or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A's efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased.      Donald Hebb (1949)},

            Understanding a network requires information on its component cells, their interactions and their functional properties. Few networks come close to providing complete information on these aspects. However, even if complete information were available it would still only provide limited insight into network function. This is because the functional and structural properties of a network are not fixed but are plastic and can change over time. The number of interacting network components, their (variable) functional properties, and various plasticity mechanisms endows networks with considerable flexibility, but these features inevitably complicate network analyses.

It will then examine the success of these analyses in a model spinal cord locomotor network in the lamprey, to determine to what extent in this relatively simple vertebrate system it is possible to claim detailed understanding of network function and plasticity.},

	abstract = {The hippocampus-prefrontal cortex (HPC-PFC) pathway plays a fundamental role in executive and emotional functions. Neurophysiological studies have begun to unveil the dynamics of HPC-PFC interaction in both immediate demands and long-term adaptations. Disruptions in HPC-PFC functional connectivity can contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in mental illnesses and neurological conditions, such as schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders, and Alzheimer’s disease. Given the role in functional and dysfunctional physiology, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms that modulate the dynamics of HPC-PFC communication. Two of the main mechanisms that regulate HPC-PFC interactions are synaptic plasticity and modulatory neurotransmission. Synaptic plasticity can be investigated inducing long-term potentiation or long-term depression, while spontaneous functional connectivity can be inferred by statistical dependencies between the local field potentials of both regions. In turn, several neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, and endocannabinoids, can regulate the fine-tuning of HPC-PFC connectivity. Despite experimental evidence, the effects of neuromodulation on HPC-PFC neuronal dynamics from cellular to behavioral levels are not fully understood. The current literature lacks a review that focuses on the main neurotransmitter interactions with HPC-PFC activity. Here we reviewed studies showing the effects of the main neurotransmitter systems in long- and short-term HPC-PFC synaptic plasticity. We also looked for the neuromodulatory effects on HPC-PFC oscillatory coordination. Finally, we review the implications of HPC-PFC disruption in synaptic plasticity and functional connectivity on cognition and neuropsychiatric disorders. The comprehensive overview of these impairments could help better understand the role of neuromodulation in HPC-PFC communication and generate insights into the etiology and physiopathology of clinical conditions.},

	abstract = {Although synaptic output is known to be modulated by changes in presynaptic calcium channels, additional pathways for calcium entry into the presynaptic terminal, such as non-selective channels, could contribute to modulation of short term synaptic dynamics. We address this issue using computational modeling. The neuropeptide proctolin modulates the inhibitory synapse from the lateral pyloric (LP) to the pyloric dilator (PD) neuron, two slow-wave bursting neurons in the pyloric network of the crab Cancer borealis. Proctolin enhances the strength of this synapse and also changes its dynamics. Whereas in control saline the synapse shows depression independent of the amplitude of the presynaptic LP signal, in proctolin, with high-amplitude presynaptic LP stimulation the synapse remains depressing while low-amplitude stimulation causes facilitation. We use simple calcium-dependent release models to explore two alternative mechanisms underlying these modulatory effects. In the first model, proctolin directly targets calcium channels by changing their activation kinetics which results in gradual accumulation of calcium with low-amplitude presynaptic stimulation, leading to facilitation. The second model uses the fact that proctolin is known to activate a non-specific cation current I                 (                   MI                 ). In this model, we assume that the MI channels have some permeability to calcium, modeled to be a result of slow conformation change after binding calcium. This generates a gradual increase in calcium influx into the presynaptic terminals through the modulatory channel similar to that described in the first model. Each of these models can explain the modulation of the synapse by proctolin but with different consequences for network activity.},

They are, directly or indirectly, involved in drug abuse and in treatment of schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactive disorder: DA autoreceptors influence the behavioral effect of cocaine and methylphenidate and may be the target of antipsychotic medications such as haloperidol. DA autoreceptors are active at two levels: Somatodendritic autoreceptors mainly influence firing rate of DA neurons, and presynaptic autoreceptors control release of neurotransmitter at axonal terminals. Here we develop a mathematical model that captures the dynamics of this dual autoregulation system. Our model predicts a biphasic autoreceptor response between DA terminals and somatodendritic regions that influences the postsynaptic integration of DAergic firing patterns. We applied our model to study how DA uptake inhibition affects the translation of DA cell firing into activation of postsynaptic DA receptors. While uptake inhibition increased tonic activation of low-affinity postsynaptic receptors, high-affinity state receptors saturated and thus became insensitive to phasic DA signaling. This effect had remarkable regional specificity: While high-affinity DA receptors saturated at low levels of uptake inhibition in nucleus accumbens, they only saturated at higher levels of uptake inhibition in dorsal striatum. Based on high-affinity receptor saturation, the model predicted that removal of autoreceptor control would lead to cocaine hypersensitivity.},

	abstract = {The capacity for neuromodulation and biophysical plasticity is a defining feature of most mature neuronal cell types. In several cases, modulation at the level of the individual neuron has been causally linked to changes in the functional output of a neuronal circuit and subsequent adaptive changes in the organism’s behavioral responses. Understanding how such capacity for neuromodulation develops therefore may provide insights into the mechanisms both of neuronal development and learning and memory. We have examined the development of multiple forms of neuromodulation triggered by a common neurotransmitter, serotonin, in the pleural sensory neurons of
              Aplysia californica
              . We have found that multiple signaling cascades within a single neuron develop sequentially, with some being expressed only very late in development. In addition, our data suggest a model in which, within a single neuromodulatory pathway, the elements of the signaling cascade are developmentally expressed in a “retrograde” manner with the ionic channel that is modulated appearing early in development, functional elements in the second messenger cascade appearing later, and finally, coupling of the second messenger cascade to the serotonin receptor appearing quite late. These studies provide the characterization of the development of neuromodulation at the level of an identified cell type and offer insights into the potential roles of neuromodulatory processes in development and adult plasticity.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Synaptic plasticity, the experience-induced change in connections between neurons, underlies learning and memory in the brain. Most of our understanding of synaptic plasticity derives from
            in vitro
            experiments with precisely repeated stimulus patterns; however, neurons exhibit significant variability
            in vivo
            during repeated experiences. Further, the spatial pattern of synaptic inputs to the dendritic tree influences synaptic plasticity, yet is not considered in most synaptic plasticity rules. Here, we address the sensitivity of plasticity to trial-to-trial variability and delineate how spatiotemporal synaptic input patterns produce plasticity with
            in vivo
            -like conditions using a data-driven computational model with a calcium-based plasticity rule. Using
            in vivo
            spike train recordings as inputs, we show that plasticity is strongly robust to trial-to-trial variability of spike timing, and derive general synaptic plasticity rules describing how spatiotemporal patterns of synaptic inputs control the magnitude and direction of plasticity. Specifically, a high temporal input firing rate to a synapse late in a trial correlated with neighboring synaptic activity produces potentiation, while an earlier, moderate firing rate that is negatively correlated with neighboring synaptic activity produces depression. Together, our results reveal that calcium dynamics can unify diverse plasticity rules and reveal how spatiotemporal firing rate patterns control synaptic plasticity.},

	abstract = {Studies of brain network connectivity improved understanding on brain changes and adaptation in response to different pathologies. Synaptic plasticity, the ability of neurons to modify their connections, is involved in brain network remodeling following different types of brain damage (e.g., vascular, neurodegenerative, inflammatory). Although synaptic plasticity mechanisms have been extensively elucidated, how neural plasticity can shape network organization is far from being completely understood. Similarities existing between synaptic plasticity and principles governing brain network organization could be helpful to define brain network properties and reorganization profiles after damage. In this review, we discuss how different forms of synaptic plasticity, including homeostatic and anti-homeostatic mechanisms, could be directly involved in generating specific brain network characteristics. We propose that long-term potentiation could represent the neurophysiological basis for the formation of highly connected nodes (hubs). Conversely, homeostatic plasticity may contribute to stabilize network activity preventing poor and excessive connectivity in the peripheral nodes. In addition, synaptic plasticity dysfunction may drive brain network disruption in neuropsychiatric conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia. Optimal network architecture, characterized by efficient information processing and resilience, and reorganization after damage strictly depend on the balance between these forms of plasticity.},

A different picture is present in neonatal hippocampal neurones, where synaptically released or exogenously applied GABA depolarizes and excites neuronal membranes - an effect that is due to a different Cl− gradient. In fact, during the early neonatal period, GABA acting on GABAA receptors provides most of the excitatory drive, whereas excitatory glutamatergic synapses are quiescent. It is suggested that during development GABA exerts mainly a trophic action through membrane depolarization and a rise in intracellular Ca2+.},

The dynamic nature of neuronal connections combined with plasticity-mediated long-lasting structural and functional alterations provide valuable insights into neuronal encoding processes as molecular substrates of not only learning and memory but potentially other sensory, motor and behavioural functions that reflect previous experience. However, one key element receiving little attention in the study of synaptic plasticity is the role of neuromodulators, which are known to orchestrate neuronal activity on brain-wide, network and synaptic scales. We aim to review current evidence on the mechanisms by which certain modulators, namely dopamine, acetylcholine, noradrenaline and serotonin, control synaptic plasticity induction through corresponding metabotropic receptors in a pathway-specific manner.

	abstract = {The nervous system generates behaviours through the activity in groups of neurons assembled into networks. Understanding these networks is thus essential to our understanding of nervous system function.
            Understanding a network requires information on its component cells, their interactions and their functional properties. Few networks come close to providing complete information on these aspects. However, even if complete information were available it would still only provide limited insight into network function. This is because the functional and structural properties of a network are not fixed but are plastic and can change over time. The number of interacting network components, their (variable) functional properties, and various plasticity mechanisms endows networks with considerable flexibility, but these features inevitably complicate network analyses.
            This review will initially discuss the general approaches and problems of network analyses. It will then examine the success of these analyses in a model spinal cord locomotor network in the lamprey, to determine to what extent in this relatively simple vertebrate system it is possible to claim detailed understanding of network function and plasticity.},

Building upon data suggesting the importance of sleep in learning and memory, we tested a hypothesis that sleep protects old memories from being forgotten after new learning. In the thalamocortical model, training a new memory interfered with previously learned old memories leading to degradation and forgetting of the old memory traces. Simulating sleep after new learning reversed the damage and enhanced old and new memories. We found that when a new memory competed for previously allocated neuronal/synaptic resources, sleep replay changed the synaptic footprint of the old memory to allow overlapping neuronal populations to store multiple memories. Our study predicts that memory storage is dynamic, and sleep enables continual learning by combining consolidation of new memory traces with reconsolidation of old memory traces to minimize interference.},

It is proposed that the quantitative level of the activity-dependent rise in postsynaptic Ca2+ determines whether the synaptic weight will increase or decrease. It is further proposed that reduction of synaptic weight is governed by protein phosphatase 1, an enzyme indirectly controlled by Ca2+ through reactions involving phosphatase inhibitor 1, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, calcineurin, and adenylate cyclase.

            The synaptic-tagging-and-capture (STC) hypothesis formulates that at each synapse the concurrence of a tag with protein synthesis yields the maintenance of changes induced by synaptic plasticity. This hypothesis provides a biological principle underlying the synaptic consolidation of memories that is not verified for recurrent neural circuits. We developed a theoretical model integrating the mechanisms underlying the STC hypothesis with calcium-based synaptic plasticity in a recurrent spiking neural network. In the model, calcium-based synaptic plasticity yields the formation of strongly interconnected cell assemblies encoding memories, followed by consolidation through the STC mechanisms. Furthermore, we show for the first time that STC mechanisms modify the storage of memories such that after several hours memory recall is significantly improved. We identify two contributing processes: a merely time-dependent passive improvement, and an active improvement during recall. The described characteristics can provide a new principle for storing information in biological and artificial neural circuits.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Brain function relies on the ability to quickly process incoming information while being capable of forming memories of past relevant events through the formation of novel synaptic connections. Synaptic connections are functionally strengthened or weakened to form new memories through synaptic plasticity rules that strongly rely on neuronal rhythmic activities. Brain information processing, on the other hand, is shaped by fluctuations in these neuronal rhythmic activities, each defining distinctive brain states, which poses the question of how such fluctuations in brain states affect the outcome of memory formation. This question is particularly relevant in the context of sleep-dependent memory consolidation, wakefulness to sleep transitions being characterized by large modifications in global neuronal activity. By combining computational models of neuronal activity switches and plasticity rules, we show that switches to rhythmic brain activity reminiscent of sleep lead to a reset in synaptic weights towards a basal value. This reset is shown to occur both in phenomenological and biophysical models of synaptic plasticity, and to be robust to neuronal and synaptic variability and network heterogeneity. Analytical analyses further show that the mechanisms of the synaptic reset are rooted in the endogenous nature of the sleep-like rhythmic activity. This sleep-dependent reset in synaptic weights permits regularizing synaptic connections during sleep, which could be a key component of sleep homeostasis and has the potential to play a central role in sleep-dependent memory consolidation.},

	abstract = {Although it is well known that long-term synaptic plasticity can be expressed both pre- and postsynaptically, the functional consequences of this arrangement have remained elusive. We show that spike-timing-dependent plasticity with both pre- and postsynaptic expression develops receptive fields with reduced variability and improved discriminability compared to postsynaptic plasticity alone. These long-term modifications in receptive field statistics match recent sensory perception experiments. Moreover, learning with this form of plasticity leaves a hidden postsynaptic memory trace that enables fast relearning of previously stored information, providing a cellular substrate for memory savings. Our results reveal essential roles for presynaptic plasticity that are missed when only postsynaptic expression of long-term plasticity is considered, and suggest an experience-dependent distribution of pre- and postsynaptic strength changes.
          , 
            Throughout life, animals must learn how to respond accurately to new sensations and environments, while retaining knowledge of previous experiences. Learning is widely believed to modify the connections (called synapses) between neurons of the cerebral cortex and other brain areas. This process is known as synaptic plasticity. Experimentally, presynaptic and postsynaptic changes have been identified, but it is not known what advantages there are to changing both components when, in principle, changing either might suffice.
            To investigate this, Costa et al. developed a mathematical model of synaptic plasticity that captured both pre- and postsynaptic changes, based on a number of experiments over the last decade from recordings in the rat sensory cortices.
            There were two major findings from this model. First, if both presynaptic and postsynaptic changes occur, the modeling results indicated that sensory perception could become more precise, as has been recently found in the rat auditory system. Second, because the details of presynaptic and postsynaptic changes are different, previously triggered changes leave behind a type of memory trace that allows apparently forgotten information to be rapidly relearned.
            Interestingly, similar asymmetries have been reported in other brain regions. One future challenge is to understand whether these findings constitute a general principle of plasticity in the brain.},

In particular, we explore the functional consequences of a biologically tuned model of pre- and postsynaptically expressed spike-timing-dependent plasticity complemented with postsynaptic homeostatic control.

Existing data point most strongly to its role in memory and homeostasis: that sleep helps maintain basic brain functioning via a homeostatic mechanism that loosens connections between overworked synapses, and that sleep helps consolidate and re-form important memories. In this review, we will summarize these theories, but also focus on substantial new information regarding the relation of electrical brain rhythms to sleep. In particular, while REM sleep may contribute to the homeostatic weakening of overactive synapses, a prominent and transient oscillatory rhythm called “sharp-wave ripple” seems to allow for consolidation of behaviorally relevant memories across many structures of the brain. We propose that a theory of sleep involving the division of labor between two states of sleep–REM and non-REM, the latter of which has an abundance of ripple electrical activity–might allow for a fusion of the two main sleep theories. This theory then postulates that sleep performs a combination of consolidation and homeostasis that promotes optimal knowledge retention as well as optimal waking brain function.},

The neuromodulators acetylcholine and noradrenaline are separately proposed as saliency signals that dictate memory encoding but it is not known if they represent distinct signals with separate mechanisms. Here, we show experimentally that acetylcholine, and to a lesser extent noradrenaline, suppress feed-forward inhibition and enhance Excitatory–Inhibitory ratio in the mossy fiber pathway but CA3 recurrent network properties are only altered by acetylcholine. We explore the implications of these findings on CA3 ensemble formation using a hierarchy of models. In reconstructions of CA3 pyramidal cells, mossy fiber pathway disinhibition facilitates postsynaptic dendritic depolarization known to be required for synaptic plasticity at CA3-CA3 recurrent synapses. We further show in a spiking neural network model of CA3 how acetylcholine-specific network alterations can drive rapid overlapping ensemble formation. Thus, through these distinct sets of mechanisms, acetylcholine and noradrenaline facilitate the formation of neuronal ensembles in CA3 that encode salient episodic memories in the hippocampus but acetylcholine selectively enhances the density of memory storage.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Memories are thought to be stored in neural ensembles known as engrams that are specifically reactivated during memory recall. Recent studies have found that memory engrams of two events that happened close in time tend to overlap in the hippocampus and the amygdala, and these overlaps have been shown to support memory linking. It has been hypothesised that engram overlaps arise from the mechanisms that regulate memory allocation itself, involving neural excitability, but the exact process remains unclear. Indeed, most theoretical studies focus on synaptic plasticity and little is known about the role of intrinsic plasticity, which could be mediated by neural excitability and serve as a complementary mechanism for forming memory engrams. Here, we developed a rate-based recurrent neural network that includes both synaptic plasticity and neural excitability. We obtained structural and functional overlap of memory engrams for contexts that are presented close in time, consistent with experimental studies. Moreover, we showed that enhancing the initial excitability of a subset of neurons just before presenting a context biases the memory allocation to these neurons. We then explored the role of inhibition as a way of controlling competition among neurons from two ensembles. This work suggests mechanisms underlying the role of intrinsic excitability in memory allocation and linking, and yields predictions regarding the dynamics of memory engrams.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Brain function relies on the ability to quickly process incoming information while being capable of forming memories of past relevant events through the formation of novel synaptic connections. Synaptic connections are functionally strengthened or weakened to form new memories through synaptic plasticity rules that strongly rely on neuronal rhythmic activities. Brain information processing, on the other hand, is shaped by fluctuations in these neuronal rhythmic activities, each defining distinctive brain states, which poses the question of how such fluctuations in brain states affect the outcome of memory formation. This question is particularly relevant in the context of sleep-dependent memory consolidation, wakefulness to sleep transitions being characterized by large modifications in global neuronal activity. By combining computational models of neuronal activity switches and plasticity rules, we show that switches to rhythmic brain activity reminiscent of sleep lead to a reset in synaptic weights towards a basal value. This reset is shown to occur both in phenomenological and biophysical models of synaptic plasticity, and to be robust to neuronal and synaptic variability and network heterogeneity. Analytical analyses further show that the mechanisms of the synaptic reset are rooted in the endogenous nature of the sleep-like rhythmic activity. This sleep-dependent reset in synaptic weights permits regularizing synaptic connections during sleep, which could be a key component of sleep homeostasis and has the potential to play a central role in sleep-dependent memory consolidation.},

However, models that rely solely on pre and postsynaptic activity for synaptic changes have, to date, not been able to account for learning complex tasks that demand hierarchical networks. Here, we show that if synaptic plasticity is regulated by high-frequency bursts of spikes, then neurons higher in the hierarchy can coordinate the plasticity of lower-level connections. Using simulations and mathematical analyses, we demonstrate that, when paired with short-term synaptic dynamics, regenerative activity in the apical dendrites, and synaptic plasticity in feedback pathways, a burst-dependent learning rule can solve challenging tasks that require deep network architectures. Our results demonstrate that well-known properties of dendrites, synapses, and synaptic plasticity are sufficient to enable sophisticated learning in hierarchical circuits.},

            Pyramidal cells (PCs) form the backbone of the layered structure of the neocortex, and plasticity of their synapses is thought to underlie learning in the brain. However, such long-term synaptic changes have been experimentally characterized between only a few types of PCs, posing a significant barrier for studying neocortical learning mechanisms. Here we introduce a model of synaptic plasticity based on data-constrained postsynaptic calcium dynamics, and show in a neocortical microcircuit model that a single parameter set is sufficient to unify the available experimental findings on long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of PC connections. In particular, we find that the diverse plasticity outcomes across the different PC types can be explained by cell-type-specific synaptic physiology, cell morphology and innervation patterns, without requiring type-specific plasticity. Generalizing the model to in vivo extracellular calcium concentrations, we predict qualitatively different plasticity dynamics from those observed in vitro. This work provides a first comprehensive null model for LTP/LTD between neocortical PC types in vivo, and an open framework for further developing models of cortical synaptic plasticity.},

Theoretical analysis combined with patch clamp recordings from pairs of neocortical pyramidal neurons revealed that the rate of synaptic depression, which depends on the probability of neurotransmitter release, dictates the extent to which firing rate and temporal coherence of action potentials within a presynaptic population are signaled to the postsynaptic neuron. The postsynaptic response primarily reflects rates of firing when depression is slow and temporal coherence when depression is fast. A wide range of rates of synaptic depression between different pairs of pyramidal neurons was found, suggesting that the relative contribution of rate and temporal signals varies along a continuum. We conclude that by setting the rate of synaptic depression, release probability is an important factor in determining the neural code.},

We built a biochemically detailed model of post-synaptic plasticity describing CaMKII, PKA, and PKC pathways and their contribution to synaptic potentiation or depression. We developed a statistical AMPA-receptor-tetramer model, which permits the estimation of the AMPA-receptor-mediated maximal synaptic conductance based on numbers of GluR1s and GluR2s predicted by the biochemical signalling model. We show that our model reproduces neuromodulator-gated spike-timing-dependent plasticity as observed in the visual cortex and can be fit to data from many cortical areas, uncovering the biochemical contributions of the pathways pinpointed by the underlying experimental studies. Our model explains the dependence of different forms of plasticity on the availability of different proteins and can be used for the study of mental disorder-associated impairments of cortical plasticity.},

It is often assumed that such beneficial effects are due to the reactivation of neural circuits in sleep to further strengthen the synapses modified during wake or transfer memories to different parts of the brain. A different possibility is that sleep may benefit memory not by further strengthening synapses, but rather by renormalizing synaptic strength to restore cellular homeostasis after net synaptic potentiation in wake. In this way, the sleep-dependent reactivation of neural circuits could result in the competitive down-selection of synapses that are activated infrequently and fit less well with the overall organization of memories. By using computer simulations, we show here that synaptic down-selection is in principle sufficient to explain the beneficial effects of sleep on the consolidation of procedural and declarative memories, on gist extraction, and on the integration of new with old memories, thereby addressing the plasticity-stability dilemma.},

We developed a theoretical model integrating the mechanisms underlying the STC hypothesis with calcium-based synaptic plasticity in a recurrent spiking neural network. In the model, calcium-based synaptic plasticity yields the formation of strongly interconnected cell assemblies encoding memories, followed by consolidation through the STC mechanisms. Furthermore, we show for the first time that STC mechanisms modify the storage of memories such that after several hours memory recall is significantly improved. We identify two contributing processes: a merely time-dependent passive improvement, and an active improvement during recall. The described characteristics can provide a new principle for storing information in biological and artificial neural circuits.},

Learning rules of the brain must therefore bridge the gap between these two different time scales. Modern theories of synaptic plasticity have postulated that the co-activation of pre- and postsynaptic neurons sets a flag at the synapse, called an eligibility trace, that leads to a weight change only if an additional factor is present while the flag is set. This third factor, signaling reward, punishment, surprise, or novelty, could be implemented by the phasic activity of neuromodulators or specific neuronal inputs signaling special events. While the theoretical framework has been developed over the last decades, experimental evidence in support of eligibility traces on the time scale of seconds has been collected only during the last few years. Here we review, in the context of three-factor rules of synaptic plasticity, four key experiments that support the role of synaptic eligibility traces in combination with a third factor as a biological implementation of neoHebbian three-factor learning rules.},

While the emphasis of the text is on conceptual models and mathematical theories, we also discuss some experimental evidence for neuromodulation of Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity.

Brain plasticity is a lifelong process and involves both Hebbian and non-Hebbian synaptic plasticity. The latter, such as intrinsic plasticity and homeostatic synaptic plasticity or synaptic scaling, is thought to counteract Hebbian plasticity, in order to maintain a balanced network. Recent studies support the role of sleep in the regulation of homeostatic synaptic plasticity involved in memory and learning processes. Most evidence focus on the dependence of memory and plasticity in sleep mechanisms. Abnormal brain plasticity during sleep might be implicated in the development of movement disorders, particularly Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dystonia. From that, the great interest to understand the underlying process of sleep in relation to movement disorders. The first objective of the review is to summarize the latest knowledge about brain plasticity. The second objective is to analyze the association between sleep, memory and brain plasticity. Finally, the review aims to assess the consequence of abnormal plasticity during PD and dystonia with a viewpoint on the underling pathogenesis of these disorders.},

	abstract = {Synapses undergo rapid activity-dependent plasticity to store information, which when left uncompensated can lead to destabilization of neural function. It has been well documented that homeostatic changes, which operate at a slower time scale, are required to maintain stability of neural networks. While there are many mechanisms that can endow homeostatic control, sliding threshold and synaptic scaling are unique in that they operate by providing homeostatic control of synaptic strength. The former mechanism operates by adjusting the threshold for synaptic plasticity, while the latter mechanism directly alters the gain of synapses. Both modes of homeostatic synaptic plasticity have been studied across various preparations from reduced
systems, such as neuronal cultures, to
intact circuitry. While most of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of homeostatic synaptic plasticity have been worked out using reduced preparations, there are unique challenges present in intact circuitry
, which deserve further consideration. For example, in an intact circuit, neurons receive distinct set of inputs across their dendritic tree which carry unique information. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity
needs to operate without compromising processing of these distinct set of inputs to preserve information processing while maintaining network stability. In this mini review, we will summarize unique features of
homeostatic synaptic plasticity, and discuss how sliding threshold and synaptic scaling may act across different activity regimes to provide homeostasis.},

	abstract = {Part of hippocampal and cortical plasticity is characterized by synaptic modifications that depend on the joint activity of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons. To which extent those changes are determined by the exact timing and the average firing rates is still a matter of debate; this may vary from brain area to brain area, as well as across neuron types. However, it has been robustly observed both in vitro and in vivo that plasticity itself slowly adapts as a function of the dynamical context, a phenomena commonly referred to as metaplasticity. An alternative concept considers the regulation of groups of synapses with an objective at the neuronal level, for example, maintaining a given average firing rate. In that case, the change in the strength of a particular synapse of the group (e.g., due to Hebbian learning) affects others' strengths, which has been coined as heterosynaptic plasticity. Classically, Hebbian synaptic plasticity is paired in neuron network models with such mechanisms in order to stabilize the activity and/or the weight structure. Here, we present an oriented review that brings together various concepts from heterosynaptic plasticity to metaplasticity, and show how they interact with Hebbian-type learning. We focus on approaches that are nowadays used to incorporate those mechanisms to state-of-the-art models of spiking plasticity inspired by experimental observations in the hippocampus and cortex. Making the point that metaplasticity is an ubiquitous mechanism acting on top of classical Hebbian learning and promoting the stability of neural function over multiple timescales, we stress the need for incorporating it as a key element in the framework of plasticity models. Bridging theoretical and experimental results suggests a more functional role for metaplasticity mechanisms than simply stabilizing neural activity.},

We observed that STDP-induced LTP was either unaffected, blocked or flipped into LTD by the network burst, and that STDP-induced LTD was either saturated or flipped into LTP, depending on the relative timing of the network burst with respect to spike coincidences of the STDP event. We hypothesized that network bursts flip STDP-induced LTP to LTD by depleting resources needed for LTP and therefore developed a resource-dependent STDP learning rule. In a model neural network under the influence of the proposed resource-dependent STDP rule, we found that excitatory synaptic coupling was homeostatically regulated to produce power law distributed burst amplitudes reflecting self-organized criticality, a state that ensures optimal information coding.},

	abstract = {This study proposes voltage-dependent-synaptic plasticity (VDSP), a novel brain-inspired unsupervised local learning rule for the online implementation of Hebb's plasticity mechanism on neuromorphic hardware. The proposed VDSP learning rule updates the synaptic conductance on the spike of the postsynaptic neuron only, which reduces by a factor of two the number of updates with respect to standard spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). This update is dependent on the membrane potential of the presynaptic neuron, which is readily available as part of neuron implementation and hence does not require additional memory for storage. Moreover, the update is also regularized on synaptic weight and prevents explosion or vanishing of weights on repeated stimulation. Rigorous mathematical analysis is performed to draw an equivalence between VDSP and STDP. To validate the system-level performance of VDSP, we train a single-layer spiking neural network (SNN) for the recognition of handwritten digits. We report 85.01 \$ {\textbackslash}pm \$ 0.76\% (Mean \$ {\textbackslash}pm \$ S.D.) accuracy for a network of 100 output neurons on the MNIST dataset. The performance improves when scaling the network size (89.93 \$ {\textbackslash}pm \$ 0.41\% for 400 output neurons, 90.56 \$ {\textbackslash}pm \$ 0.27 for 500 neurons), which validates the applicability of the proposed learning rule for spatial pattern recognition tasks. Future work will consider more complicated tasks. Interestingly, the learning rule better adapts than STDP to the frequency of input signal and does not require hand-tuning of hyperparameters},

	abstract = {We review a body of theoretical and experimental research on Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity, starting from a puzzling observation: while homeostasis of synapses found in experiments is a slow compensatory process, most mathematical models of synaptic plasticity use rapid compensatory processes (RCPs). Even worse, with the slow homeostatic plasticity reported in experiments, simulations of existing plasticity models cannot maintain network stability unless further control mechanisms are implemented. To solve this paradox, we suggest that in addition to slow forms of homeostatic plasticity there are RCPs which stabilize synaptic plasticity on short timescales. These rapid processes may include heterosynaptic depression triggered by episodes of high postsynaptic firing rate. While slower forms of homeostatic plasticity are not sufficient to stabilize Hebbian plasticity, they are important for fine-tuning neural circuits. Taken together we suggest that learning and memory rely on an intricate interplay of diverse plasticity mechanisms on different timescales which jointly ensure stability and plasticity of neural circuits.

	abstract = {Synaptic plasticity is important for learning and memory. With increasing evidence linking sleep states to changes in synaptic strength, an emerging view is that sleep promotes learning and memory by facilitating experience-induced synaptic plasticity. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on the function of sleep in regulating cortical synaptic plasticity. Specifically, we outline the electroencephalogram signatures of sleep states (e.g. slow-wave sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, spindles), sleep state-dependent changes in gene and synaptic protein expression, synaptic morphology, and neuronal and network activity. We highlight studies showing that post-experience sleep potentiates experience-induced synaptic changes and discuss the potential mechanisms that may link sleep-related brain activity to synaptic structural remodelling. We conclude that both synapse formation or strengthening and elimination or weakening occur across sleep. This sleep-dependent synaptic plasticity plays an important role in neuronal circuit refinement during development and after learning, while sleep disorders may contribute to or exacerbate the development of common neurological diseases.

Although there are some commercial devices with varying levels of technical complexity that are claimed to improve sleep-dependent memory processing, none of them have been empirically validated. The main issue seems to be that there is basically no applied research in the field of sleep and memory. To change this, we identify the most promising targets for sleep-based memory-improvement applications. We outline the theoretical and technical aspects of the most promising memory-enhancing sleep interventions established in recent years and highlight potential targets of such interventions for different healthy and clinical populations. Finally, we propose a unifying framework that will lay the groundwork for a focused applied-research program in sleep and memory, bridging the gap between basic research and targeted application.},

	abstract = {TNRNFLRFamide was isolated and sequenced from the stomatogastric nervous system of the crab Cancer borealis by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography followed by automated Edman degradation. An SDRNFLRFamide-like peptide that exactly co-migrated with SDRNFLRFamide was also observed. The effects of TNRNFLRFamide and SDRNFLRFamide on the gastric and pyloric rhythms of the stomatogastric nervous system of the crab Cancer borealis were studied. Both peptides activated pyloric rhythms in quiescent preparations in a dose-dependent manner with a threshold between 10 Ϫ11 and 10Ϫ10 mol l–1. Both peptides increased the pyloric rhythm frequency of preparations showing moderate activity levels and had relatively little effect on preparations that showed strong pyloric rhythms prior to peptide application. Both peptides evoked gastric mill activity in preparations without existing gastric rhythms. The activation of the gastric rhythm is associated with activation of oscillatory properties in the dorsal gastric neurone. The induction of gastric rhythms by these peptides was accompanied by switches from pyloric-timed activity to gastric-timed activity by several stomatogastric ganglion neurones. Application of these peptides provides direct experimental control of circuit modiﬁcation in the stomatogastric nervous system.},

In the companion paper, we found that self-sustained firing was persistent for long periods only in motoneurons with low rheobases and slow axonal conduction velocities. High rheobase, fast conduction velocity motoneurons tend to be only partially bistable in that self-sustained firing lasts at most 1–2 s. The mechanisms underlying these differences between fully and partially bistable motoneurons were investigated by measuring their current voltage ( I-V) relationships in the decerebrate cat preparation after administration of the noradrenergic α

              agonist methoxamine. Slow (8 mV/s) triangular voltage commands were applied using the discontinuous single-electrode voltage-clamp technique. Both fully and partially bistable cells exhibited a region of negative I-V slope due to activation of a strong, persistent inward current. The peak amplitude of the total persistent inward current ( I

In an in vitro preparation of the spinal cord of the turtle we now show that serotonin, applied directly to the bath, transforms the intrinsic response properties of motoneurons, uncovering a plateau potential and voltage sensitive bistability. The changes induced by serotonin were blocked by Mn++, while the plateau potential and the bistability remained after application of tetrodotoxin. We conclude that serotonin controls the expression of a Ca++ dependent plateau potential in motoneurons.},

            Almost seventy years after the discovery of the mechanisms of action potential generation, some aspects of their computational consequences are still not fully understood. Based on mathematical modeling, we here explore a type of action potential dynamics – arising from a saddle-node homoclinic orbit bifurcation - that so far has received little attention. We show that this type of dynamics is to be expected by specific changes in common physiological parameters, like an elevation of temperature. Moreover, we demonstrate that it favours synchronization patterns in networks – a feature that becomes particularly prominent when system parameters change such that homoclinic spiking is induced. Supported by in-vitro hallmarks for homoclinic spikes in the rodent brain, we hypothesize that the prevalence of homoclinic spikes in the brain may be underestimated and provide a missing link between the impact of biophysical parameters on abrupt transitions between asynchronous and synchronous states of electrical activity in the brain.},

              ) and hyperpolarization-activated inward (I
              H

There is a continuum of mechanisms in circuits that generate antiphase oscillations, with ‘release’ and ‘escape’ mechanisms at the extremes, and mixed mode oscillations between these extremes. In release, the active neuron primarily controls the off/on transitions. In escape, the inhibited neuron controls the transitions. We characterized the robustness of escape and release circuits to alterations in circuit parameters, temperature, and neuromodulation. We found that escape circuits rely on tight correlations between synaptic and H conductances to generate bursting but are resilient to temperature increase. Release circuits are robust to variations in synaptic and H conductances but fragile to temperature increase. The modulatory current (I
              MI
              ) restores oscillations in release circuits but has little effect in escape circuits. Perturbations can alter the balance of escape and release mechanisms and can create mixed mode oscillations. We conclude that the same perturbation can have dramatically different effects depending on the circuits’ mechanism of operation that may not be observable from basal circuit activity.},

            Systems consolidation refers to the time-dependent reorganization of memory representations or engrams across brain regions. Despite recent advancements in unravelling this process, the exact mechanisms behind engram dynamics and the role of associated pathways remain largely unknown. Here we propose a biologically-plausible computational model to address this knowledge gap. By coordinating synaptic plasticity timescales and incorporating a hippocampus-thalamus-cortex circuit, our model is able to couple engram reactivations across these regions and thereby reproduce key dynamics of cortical and hippocampal engram cells along with their interdependencies. Decoupling hippocampal-thalamic-cortical activity disrupts systems consolidation. Critically, our model yields testable predictions regarding hippocampal and thalamic engram cells, inhibitory engrams, thalamic inhibitory input, and the effect of thalamocortical synaptic coupling on retrograde amnesia induced by hippocampal lesions. Overall, our results suggest that systems consolidation emerges from coupled reactivations of engram cells in distributed brain regions enabled by coordinated synaptic plasticity timescales in multisynaptic subcortical-cortical circuits.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Brain function relies on the ability to quickly process incoming information while being capable of forming memories of past relevant events through the formation of novel synaptic connections. Synaptic connections are functionally strengthened or weakened to form new memories through synaptic plasticity rules that strongly rely on neuronal rhythmic activities. Brain information processing, on the other hand, is shaped by fluctuations in these neuronal rhythmic activities, each defining distinctive brain states, which poses the question of how such fluctuations in brain states affect the outcome of memory formation. This question is particularly relevant in the context of sleep-dependent memory consolidation, wakefulness to sleep transitions being characterized by large modifications in global neuronal activity. By combining computational models of neuronal activity switches and plasticity rules, we show that switches to rhythmic brain activity reminiscent of sleep lead to a reset in synaptic weights towards a basal value. This reset is shown to occur both in phenomenological and biophysical models of synaptic plasticity, and to be robust to neuronal and synaptic variability and network heterogeneity. Analytical analyses further show that the mechanisms of the synaptic reset are rooted in the endogenous nature of the sleep-like rhythmic activity. This sleep-dependent reset in synaptic weights permits regularizing synaptic connections during sleep, which could be a key component of sleep homeostasis and has the potential to play a central role in sleep-dependent memory consolidation.},

              sleep deprivation modulates human brain physiology and cognition is not well understood. Here we examined how overnight sleep deprivation vs overnight sufficient sleep affects (a) cortical excitability, measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation, (b) inducibility of long-term potentiation (LTP)- and long-term depression (LTD)-like plasticity via transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and (c) learning, memory, and attention. The results suggest that sleep deprivation upscales cortical excitability due to enhanced glutamate-related cortical facilitation and decreases and/or reverses GABAergic cortical inhibition. Furthermore, tDCS-induced LTP-like plasticity (anodal) abolishes while the inhibitory LTD-like plasticity (cathodal) converts to excitatory LTP-like plasticity under sleep deprivation. This is associated with increased EEG theta oscillations due to sleep pressure. Finally, we show that learning and memory formation, behavioral counterparts of plasticity, and working memory and attention, which rely on cortical excitability, are impaired during sleep deprivation. Our data indicate that upscaled brain excitability and altered plasticity, due to sleep deprivation, are associated with impaired cognitive performance. Besides showing how brain physiology and cognition undergo changes (from neurophysiology to higher-order cognition) under sleep pressure, the findings have implications for

	abstract = {Abstract
            In systems consolidation, encoded memories are replayed by the hippocampus during slow-wave sleep (SWS), and permanently stored in the neocortex. Declarative memory consolidation is believed to benefit from the oscillatory rhythms and low cholinergic tone observed in this sleep stage, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To clarify the role of cholinergic modulation and synchronized activity in memory consolidation, we applied repeated electrical stimulation in mature cultures of dissociated rat cortical neurons with high or low cholinergic tone, mimicking the cue replay observed during systems consolidation under distinct cholinergic concentrations. In the absence of cholinergic input, these cultures display activity patterns hallmarked by network bursts, synchronized events reminiscent of the low frequency oscillations observed during SWS. They display stable activity and connectivity, which mutually interact and achieve an equilibrium. Electrical stimulation reforms the equilibrium to include the stimulus response, a phenomenon interpreted as memory trace formation. Without cholinergic input, activity was burst-dominated. First application of a stimulus induced significant connectivity changes, while subsequent repetition no longer affected connectivity. Presenting a second stimulus at a different electrode had the same effect, whereas returning to the initial stimuli did not induce further connectivity alterations, indicating that the second stimulus did not erase the ‘memory trace’ of the first. Distinctively, cultures with high cholinergic tone displayed reduced network excitability and dispersed firing, and electrical stimulation did not induce significant connectivity changes. We conclude that low cholinergic tone facilitates memory formation and consolidation, possibly through enhanced network excitability. Network bursts or SWS oscillations may merely reflect high network excitability.},

Here, we propose that reactivation-induced synaptic plasticity can solve this problem. Previously, we reported that the reinforcement signal dopamine converts hippocampal spike timing-dependent depression into potentiation during continued synaptic activity (Brzosko et al., 2015). Here, we report that postsynaptic bursts in the presence of dopamine produce input-specific LTP in mouse hippocampal synapses 10 min after they were primed with coincident pre- and post-synaptic activity (post-before-pre pairing; Δt = –20 ms). This priming activity induces synaptic depression and sets an NMDA receptor-dependent silent eligibility trace which, through the cAMP-PKA cascade, is rapidly converted into protein synthesis-dependent synaptic potentiation, mediated by a signaling pathway distinct from that of conventional LTP. This synaptic learning rule was incorporated into a computational model, and we found that it adds specificity to reinforcement learning by controlling memory allocation and enabling both ‘instructive’ and ‘supervised’ reinforcement learning. We predicted that this mechanism would make reactivated neurons activate more strongly and carry more spatial information than non-reactivated cells, which was confirmed in freely moving mice performing a reward-based navigation task.},

In particular, we explore the functional consequences of a biologically tuned model of pre- and postsynaptically expressed spike-timing-dependent plasticity complemented with postsynaptic homeostatic control. The pre- and postsynaptic expression in this model predicts (i) more reliable receptive fields and sensory perception, (ii) rapid recovery of forgotten information (memory savings), and (iii) reduced response latencies, compared with a model with postsynaptic expression only. Finally, we discuss open questions that will require a considerable research effort to better elucidate how the specific locus of expression of homeostatic and Hebbian plasticity alters synaptic and network computations.

	abstract = {Hebbian plasticity is widely considered to be the mechanism by which information can be coded and retained in neurons in the brain. Homeostatic plasticity moves the neuron back towards its original state following a perturbation, including perturbations produced by Hebbian plasticity. How then does homeostatic plasticity avoid erasing the Hebbian coded information? To understand how plasticity works in the brain, and therefore to understand learning, memory, sensory adaptation, development and recovery from injury, requires development of a theory of plasticity that integrates both forms of plasticity into a whole. In April 2016, a group of computational and experimental neuroscientists met in London at a discussion meeting hosted by the Royal Society to identify the critical questions in the field and to frame the research agenda for the next steps. Here, we provide a brief introduction to the papers arising from the meeting and highlight some of the themes to have emerged from the discussions.

	abstract = {Brain networks store new memories using functional and structural synaptic plasticity. Memory formation is generally attributed to Hebbian plasticity, while homeostatic plasticity is thought to have an ancillary role in stabilizing network dynamics. Here we report that homeostatic plasticity alone can also lead to the formation of stable memories. We analyze this phenomenon using a new theory of network remodeling, combined with numerical simulations of recurrent spiking neural networks that exhibit structural plasticity based on firing rate homeostasis. These networks are able to store repeatedly presented patterns and recall them upon the presentation of incomplete cues. Storage is fast, governed by the homeostatic drift. In contrast, forgetting is slow, driven by a diffusion process. Joint stimulation of neurons induces the growth of associative connections between them, leading to the formation of memory engrams. These memories are stored in a distributed fashion throughout connectivity matrix, and individual synaptic connections have only a small influence. Although memory-specific connections are increased in number, the total number of inputs and outputs of neurons undergo only small changes during stimulation. We find that homeostatic structural plasticity induces a specific type of “silent memories”, different from conventional attractor states.},

	abstract = {Thalamic neurons can exhibit two distinct firing modes: tonic and burst. In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the tonic mode appears as a relatively faithful relay of visual information from retina to cortex. The function of the burst mode is less understood. Its prevalence during slow-wave sleep (SWS) and linkage to synchronous cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) suggest that it has an important role during this form of sleep. Although not nearly as common, bursting can also occur during wakefulness. The goal of this study was to identify conditions that affect burst probability, and to compare burst incidence during sleeping and waking. LGN neurons are extraordinarily heterogenous in the degree to which they burst, during both sleeping and waking. Some LGN neurons never burst under any conditions during wakefulness, and several never burst during slow-wave sleep. During wakefulness, {\textless}1\% of action potentials were associated with bursting, whereas during sleep this fraction jumps to 18\%. Although bursting was most common during slow-wave sleep, more than 50\% of the bursting originated from 14\% of the LGN cells. Bursting during sleep was largely restricted to episodes lasting 1–5 s, with ∼47\% of these episodes being rhythmic and in the delta frequency range (0.5–4 Hz). In wakefulness, although visual stimulation accounted for the greatest number of bursts, it was still a small fraction of the total response (4\%, 742 bursts/17,744 cycles in 93 cells). We identified two variables that appeared to influence burst probability: size of the visual stimuli used to elicit responses and behavioral state. Increased stimulus size increased burst probability. We attribute this to the increased influence large stimuli have on a cell's inhibitory mechanisms. As with sleep, a large fraction of bursting originated from a small number of cells. During visual stimulation, 50\% of bursting was generated by 9\% of neurons. Increased vigilance was negatively correlated with burst probability. Visual stimuli presented during active fixation (i.e., when the animal must fixate on an overt fixation point) were less likely to produce bursting, than when the same visual stimuli were presented but no fixation point present (“passive” fixation). Such observations suggest that even brief departures from attentive states can hyperpolarize neurons sufficiently to de-inactivate the burst mechanism. Our results provide a new view of the temporal structure of bursting during slow-wave sleep; one that supports episodic rhythmic activity in the intact animal. In addition, because bursting could be tied to specific conditions within wakefulness, we suggest that bursting has a specific function within that state.},

 underlying learning and memory focus on synaptic efficacy and make the
 implicit assumption that changes in synaptic efficacy are both

 network dynamics depends on the complex interaction between intrinsic
 membrane properties and synaptic strengths and time courses.
 Furthermore, neuronal activity itself modifies not only synaptic
 efficacy but also the intrinsic membrane properties of neurons. This
 paper presents examples demonstrating that neurons with complex
 temporal dynamics can provide short-term “memory” mechanisms that
 rely solely on intrinsic neuronal properties. Additionally, we discuss
 the potential role that activity may play in long-term modification of
 intrinsic neuronal properties. While not replacing synaptic plasticity
 as a powerful learning mechanism, these examples suggest that memory in
 networks results from an ongoing interplay between changes in synaptic
 efficacy and intrinsic membrane properties.},

Burst firing consists of groups of relatively high-frequency spikes separated by quiescence. Neurons in a variety of brain areas, including the thalamus, hypothalamus, cortex, and hippocampus, display burst firing, but the ionic mechanisms that generating burst firing and the related physiological functions vary among regions. In this review, we summarize recent findings on the mechanisms underlying burst firing in various brain areas, as well as the roles of burst firing in several mental and neurological disorders.

We established the excitatory input conditions on the basal versus the apical tree that favor burst and show that there are two distinct types of bursts. Bursts consisting of 3 or more spikes firing at {\textless} 200 Hz, which are generated by stronger excitatory input to the basal versus the apical tree, and bursts of {\textasciitilde}2-spikes at {\textasciitilde}250 Hz, generated by prominent apical tuft excitation.

            Working memories have long been thought to be maintained by persistent spiking. However, mounting evidence from multiple-electrode recording (and single-trial analyses) shows that the underlying spiking is better characterized by intermittent bursts of activity. A counterargument suggested this intermittent activity is at odds with observations that spike-time variability reduces during task performance. However, this counterargument rests on assumptions, such as randomness in the timing of the bursts, which may not be correct. Thus, we analyzed spiking and LFPs from monkeys’ prefrontal cortex (PFC) to determine if task-related reductions in variability can co-exist with intermittent spiking. We found that it does because both spiking and associated gamma bursts were task-modulated, not random. In fact, the task-related reduction in spike variability could largely be explained by a related reduction in gamma burst variability. Our results provide further support for the intermittent activity models of working memory as well as novel mechanistic insights into how spike variability is reduced during cognitive tasks.},

	abstract = {1. Our experiments were performed to assess the quantitative role of the transient potassium current, IA, in determining the cycle frequency and phasing of neurons in the network generating the pyloric motor rhythm in the stomatogastric ganglion of the spiny lobster, Panulirus interruptus. We used 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) to reduce IA and recorded the effects of this treatment on cell activity. 2. In the intact circuit with an actively cycling pyloric rhythm, 4-AP had three major effects on the rhythm. First, the cycle period was decreased approximately 20\%. Second, 4-AP enhanced the activity of all cells, causing increases in spikes/burst and spike frequency within bursts. Third, 4-AP altered the phasing of follower cells relative to the onset of the pacemaker (AB/PD) bursts. The lateral pyloric (LP) and pylorics (PYs) were phase advanced by 4-AP, whereas the ventral dilator (VD) was phase delayed. 3. Voltage-clamp studies indicated that pyloric cells differed in the amount of IA they expressed on or near the soma. IA was largest in pyloric dilator (PD) and PY cells, smaller in the anterior burster (AB), LP, and inferior cardiac (IC) cells, and undetectable in the VD cell. When cells were isolated from synaptic input, however, all were excited by 4-AP, suggesting that all possess functionally significant IA. In VD cells, IA-like currents probably occur primarily in nonsomatic cell regions. 4. We measured postinhibitory rebound by determining the delay to the first spike after a series of 200-ms hyperpolarizing prepulses in the PD, PY, LP, VD, and IC cells. In all five cell types, the delay was progressively increased as the potential of the hyperpolarizing prepulse became more negative. This increased delay reflected the removal of IA inactivation. The delay was greatest in the PY cell and least in the IC. In four cells (the PD, PY, LP, and VD) 4-AP decreased the delay to the first spike at all prepulse potentials. In the IC the delay to the first spike was unaffected by 4-AP, suggesting that IA was not responsible for the relatively short delay after hyperpolarizing prepulses. 5. In all five cell types, 4-AP increased the spike frequency for the duration of a 1-s depolarization. The 4-AP-sensitive current responsible for this behavior appears to have very rapid kinetics and may represent a distinct channel subtype. Functionally, this current may act to dampen cell excitability and to reduce spike frequency during bursts.},

The similarity in electrophysiological properties unambiguously indicates that the thalamocortical system must be as ancient as the vertebrate branch itself. We address the view that rather than simply relays, thalamic neurons have sui generis intrinsic electrical properties that govern their specific functional dynamics and regulate natural functional states such as sleep and vigilance. In addition, thalamocortical activity has been shown to be involved in the genesis of several neuropsychiatric conditions collectively described as thalamocortical dysrhythmia syndrome.},

	abstract = {Subfornical organ (SFO) neurons exhibit heterogeneity in current expression and spiking behavior, where the two major spiking phenotypes appear as tonic and burst firing. Insight into the mechanisms behind this heterogeneity is critical for understanding how the SFO, a sensory circumventricular organ, integrates and selectively influences physiological function. To integrate efficient methods for studying this heterogeneity, we built a single-compartment, Hodgkin-Huxley-type model of an SFO neuron that is parameterized by SFO-specific in vitro patch-clamp data. The model accounts for the membrane potential distribution and spike train variability of both tonic and burst firing SFO neurons. Analysis of model dynamics confirms that a persistent Na

              current may be responsible for burst termination in SFO neurons. Additionally, the model suggests that heterogeneity in current expression and subsequent influence on spike afterpotential underlie the behavioral differences between tonic and burst firing SFO neurons. Future use of this model in coordination with single neuron patch-clamp electrophysiology provides a platform for explaining and predicting the response of SFO neurons to various combinations of circulating signals, thus elucidating the mechanisms underlying physiological signal integration within the SFO.
            
            NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Our understanding of how the subfornical organ (SFO) selectively influences autonomic nervous system function remains incomplete but theoretically results from the electrical responses of SFO neurons to physiologically important signals. We have built a computational model of SFO neurons, derived from and supported by experimental data, which explains how SFO neurons produce different electrical patterns. The model provides an efficient system to theoretically and experimentally explore how changes in the essential features of SFO neurons affect their electrical activity.},

At the same time, they are extremely robust and maintain stability despite the changes associated with adaptation. This combination of adaptability and stability is difficult to achieve, and it provides a strong constraint on any models of plasticity in neural circuits. New evidence suggests that the effect of action potential timing on synaptic plasticity may be an important element in reconciling homeostasis with adaptability. In particular, spike-timing dependent plasticity can act as both an adaptive and a homeostatic mechanism, controlling overall firing rates and distributions of synaptic efficacies while making neurons selective for certain aspects of their inputs. It can also cause networks that initially represent the present state of a stimulus to predict its future state on the basis of experience, a theoretical result supported by experimental data in behaving rats.},

These models were not completely isolated in the parameter space, but neither did they belong to a large continuum of good models that would exist if weak compensations between channels were sufficient. The parameter landscape of good models can best be described as a set of loosely connected hyperplanes. Our method is efficient in finding good models in this complex landscape.

We produced multiple different models that exhibit a triphasic pyloric rhythm over a range of temperatures and explored the dynamics of their currents and how they change with temperature. Temperature can produce smooth changes in the relative contributions of the currents to neural activity so that neurons and networks undergo graceful transitions in the mechanisms that give rise to their activity patterns. Moreover, responses of the models to deletions of a current can be different at high and low temperatures, indicating that even a well-defined genetic or pharmacological manipulation may produce qualitatively distinct effects depending on the temperature.},

Using patch-clamp recordings of TC neurons in brain slices from mice and a realistic conductance-based computational model, we characterized seven subthreshold ion currents of TC neurons and quantified their individual contributions to the total steady-state conductance at levels below tonic firing threshold. We then used the TC neuron model to show that the resting membrane potential results from the interplay of several inward and outward currents over a background provided by the potassium and sodium leak currents. The steady-state conductances of depolarizing Ih (hyperpolarization-activated cationic current), IT (low-threshold calcium current), and INaP (persistent sodium current) move the membrane potential away from the reversal potential of the leak conductances. This depolarization is counteracted in turn by the hyperpolarizing steady-state current of IA (fast transient A-type potassium current) and IKir (inwardly rectifying potassium current). Using the computational model, we have shown that single parameter variations compatible with physiological or pathological modulation promote burst firing periodicity. The balance between three amplifying variables (activation of IT, activation of INaP, and activation of IKir) and three recovering variables (inactivation of IT, activation of IA, and activation of Ih) determines the propensity, or lack thereof, of repetitive burst firing of TC neurons. We also have determined the specific roles that each of these variables have during the intrinsic oscillation. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.},

	abstract = {A mathematical model of midbrain dopamine neurons has been developed to understand the mechanisms underlying two types of calcium-dependent firing patterns that these cells exhibit in vitro. The first is the regular, pacemaker-like firing exhibited in a slice preparation, and the second is a burst firing pattern sometimes exhibited in the presence of apamin. Because both types of oscillations are blocked by nifedipine, we have focused on the slow calcium dynamics underlying these firing modes. The underlying oscillations in membrane potential are best observed when action potentials are blocked by the application of TTX. This converts the regular single-spike firing mode to a slow oscillatory potential (SOP) and apamin-induced bursting to a slow square-wave oscillation. We hypothesize that the SOP results from the interplay between the L-type calcium current (I(Ca,L)) and the apamin- sensitive calcium-activated potassium current (I(K,Ca,SK)). We further hypothesize that the square-wave oscillation results from the alternating voltage activation and calcium inactivation of I(Ca.L). Our model consists of two components: a Hodgkin-Huxley-type membrane model and a fluid compartment model. A material balance on Ca2+ is provided in the cytosolic fluid compartment, whereas calcium concentration is considered constant in the extracellular compartment. Model parameters were determined using both voltage-clamp and calcium-imaging data from the literature. In addition to modeling the SOP and square-wave oscillations in dopaminergic neurons, the model provides reasonable mimicry of the experimentally observed response of SOPs to TEA application and elongation of the plateau duration of the square- wave oscillations in response to calcium chelation.},

Here we test the hypothesis that pathological bursts in dopamine-deprived basal ganglia are generated within the STN and transmitted to globus pallidus neurons. To answer this question we recorded excitatory synaptic currents and potentials from subthalamic and pallidal neurons in the basal ganglia slice (BGS) from dopamine-depleted mice while continuously blocking GABA A receptors. In control mice, a single electrical stimulus delivered to the internal capsule or the rostral pole of the STN evoked a short duration, small amplitude, monosynaptic EPSC in subthalamic neurons. In contrast, in the dopamine-depleted BGS, this monosynaptic EPSC was amplified and followed by a burst of polysynaptic EPSCs that eventually reverberated three to seven times, providing a long lasting response that gave rise to bursts of EPSCs and spikes in GP neurons. Repetitive (10-120 Hz) stimulation delivered to the STN in the dopamine-depleted BGS attenuated STN-evoked bursts of EPSCs in pallidal neurons after several minutes of stimulation but only high frequency (90-120 Hz) stimulation replaced them with small amplitude EPSCs at 20 Hz. We propose that the polysynaptic pathway within the STN amplifies subthalamic responses to incoming excitation in the dopamine-depleted basal ganglia, thereby transforming the STN into a burst generator and entraining pallidal neurons in pathogenic bursting activities. High frequency stimulation of the STN prevents the transmission of this pathological activity to globus pallidus and imposes a new glutamatergic synaptic noise on pallidal neurons. © 2011 Ammari, Bioulac, Garcia and Hammond.},

	abstract = {Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is a widespread plasticity mechanism in the nervous system. The simplest description of STDP only takes into account pairs of pre- and postsynaptic spikes, with potentiation of the synapse when a presynaptic spike precedes a postsynaptic spike and depression otherwise. In light of experiments that explored a variety of spike patterns, the pair-based STDP model has been augmented to account for multiple pre- and postsynaptic spike interactions. As a result, a number of different “multi-spike” STDP models have been proposed based on different experimental observations. The behavior of these models at the population level is crucial for understanding mechanisms of learning and memory. The challenging balance between the stability of a population of synapses and their competitive modification is well studied for pair-based models, but it has not yet been fully analyzed for multi-spike models. Here, we address this issue through numerical simulations of an integrate-and-fire model neuron with excitatory synapses subject to STDP described by three different proposed multi-spike models. We also analytically calculate average synaptic changes and fluctuations about these averages. Our results indicate that the different multi-spike models behave quite differently at the population level. Although each model can produce synaptic competition in certain parameter regions, none of them induces synaptic competition with its originally fitted parameters. The dichotomy between synaptic stability and Hebbian competition, which is well characterized for pair-based STDP models, persists in multi-spike models. However, anti-Hebbian competition can coexist with synaptic stability in some models. We propose that the collective behavior of synaptic plasticity models at the population level should be used as an additional guideline in applying phenomenological models based on observations of single synapses.},

Oscillations ({\textbackslash}textless1 Hz) in SWS and transformation to an activated awake state were investigated with intracellular recordings in vivo and with computational models of the corticothalamic system. Occasional summation of the miniature EPSPs during the hyperpolarized (silent) phase of SWS oscillation activated the persistent sodium current and depolarized the membrane of cortical pyramidal (PY) cells sufficiently for spike generation, In the model, this triggered the active phase, which was maintained by lateral PY-PY excitation and persistent sodium current. Progressive depression of the excitatory interconnections and activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ current led to termination of the 20-25 Hz activity after 500-1000 msec. Including thalamocortical (TC) and thalamic reticular neurons in the model increased the duration of the active epochs up to 1-1.5 sec and introduced waning spindle sequences. An increase in acetylcholine activity, which is associated with activated states, was modeled by the reduction in the K+ leak current in PY and TC cells and by a decrease in intracortical PY-PY synaptic conductances. These changes eliminated the hyperpolarizing phases of network activity and transformed cortical neurons to tonic firing at 15-20 Hz. During the transition from SWS to the activated state, the input resistance of cortical neurons gradually increased and, in a fully activated state, reached the same or even higher values as during silent phases of SWS oscillations. The model describes many essential features of SWS and activated states in the thalamocortical system as well as the transition between them.},

	abstract = {The modification of the discharge pattern of subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons from single-spike activity to mixed burst-firing mode is one of the characteristics of parkinsonism in rat and primates. However, the mechanism of this process is not yet understood. Intrinsic firing patterns of STN neurons were examined in rat brain slices with intracellular and patch-clamp techniques. Almost half of the STN neurons that spontaneously discharged in the single-spike mode had the intrinsic property of switching to pure or mixed burst-firing mode when the membrane was hyperpolarized from −41.3 ± 1.0 mV (range, −35 to −50 mV; n = 15) to −51.0 ± 1.0 mV (range, −42 to −60 mV; n = 20). This switch was greatly facilitated by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors with 1S,3R-ACPD. Recurrent membrane oscillations underlying burst-firing mode were endogenous and Ca2+-dependent because they were largely reduced by nifedipine (3 μm), Ni2+ (40 μm), and BAPTA-AM (10–50 μm) at any potential tested, whereas TTX (1 μm) had no effect. In contrast, simultaneous application of TEA (1 mm) and apamin (0.2 μm) prolonged burst duration. Moreover, in response to intracellular stimulation at hyperpolarized potentials, a plateau potential with a voltage and ionic basis similar to those of spontaneous bursts was recorded in 82\% of the tested STN neurons, all of which displayed a low-threshold Ni2+-sensitive spike. We propose that recurrent membrane oscillations during bursts result from the sequential activation of T/R- and L-type Ca2+ currents, a Ca2+-activated inward current, and Ca2+-activated K+ currents.},

	abstract = {Recently, compelling evidence has accumulated that links sleep to learning and memory. Sleep has been identified as a state that optimizes the consolidation of newly acquired information in memory. Consolidation is an active process that is presumed to rely on the covert reactivation and reorganization of newly encoded representations. Hippocampus-dependent memories benefit primarily from slow-wave sleep (SWS), whereas memories not depending on the hippocampus show greater gains over periods containing high amounts of rapid eye movement sleep. One way sleep does this is by establishing different patterns of neurotransmitters and neurohormone secretion between sleep stages. Another central role for consolidating memories is played by the slow oscillation, that is, the oscillating field potential change dominating SWS. The emergence of slow oscillations in neocortical networks depends on the prior use of these networks for encoding of information. Via efferent pathways, they synchronize the occurrence of sharp wave ripples accompanying memory reactivations in the hippocampus with thalamocortical spindle activity. Thus, hippocampal memories are fed back into neocortical networks at a time when these networks are depolarized and, because of concurrent spindle activity, can most sensitively react to these inputs with plastic changes underlying the formation of long-term memory representations.

	abstract = {Functional neurosurgery in patients with movement disorders has provided a unique opportunity to record directly form the human basal ganglia (BG) and to thereby further our understanding of these 'dark basements of the mind.' Two possibilities exist: either single unit and local field potential (LFP) recordings can be made intra-operatively through microelectrodes, or LFPs may be recorded directly from the deep brain stimulation electrode in the peri-operative period. The LFPs so recorded in the BG of patients are pleomorphic, oscillatory, focal and the product of synchronised current changes in local neuronal elements. They are presently most simply classified by frequency into activities at {\textbackslash}textless8, 8-30 and {\textbackslash}textgreater60 Hz, although such a schema is unlikely to capture the full complexity of rhythmic synchronisation with respect to behavioural and disease dependency. The best characterised group of LFP oscillations is that at 8-30 Hz. This activity is prominent in the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus of Parkinsonian patients withdrawn from their dopaminergic medication. Dopaminergic treatments, behaviourally relevant stimuli and voluntary movement suppress it. The available evidence points to the 8-30 Hz activity being essentially antikinetic in character and inversely related to motor processing. Its exaggeration may therefore contribute to the bradykinesia of Parkinson's disease. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The small world-like connectivity of the cerebral cortex allows for global computation on multiple spatial and temporal scales. The perpetual interactions among the multiple network oscillators keep cortical systems in a highly sensitive metastable state and provide energy-efficient synchronizing mechanisms via weak links.

Their low threshold for activation combined with a rapid and transient calcium conductance generates low-threshold calcium potentials (LTCPs), upon the crest of which high frequency action potentials fire for a brief period. Experiments using simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and intracellular recordings demonstrate that neuronal burst-firing is a likely causative component in the generation of normal sleep patterns as well as some pathophysiological conditions, such as epileptic seizures. However, less is known as to how these neuronal bursts impact brain behavior, in particular network synchronization.

How the regulation of a cortical E/I ratio is affected by sleep and the circadian rhythm however, remains to be established. Here we addressed this issue through the analyses of TMS-evoked responses recorded over a 29 h sleep deprivation protocol conducted in young and healthy volunteers. Spectral analyses of TMS-evoked responses in frontal cortex revealed non-linear changes in gamma band evoked oscillations, compatible with an influence of circadian timing on inhibitory interneuron activity. In silico inferences of cell-to-cell excitatory and inhibitory connectivity and GABA/Glutamate receptor time constant based on neural mass modeling within the Dynamic causal modeling framework, further suggested excitation/inhibition balance was under a strong circadian influence. These results indicate that circadian changes in EEG spectral properties, in measure of excitatory/inhibitory connectivity and in GABA/glutamate receptor function could support the maintenance of cognitive performance during a normal waking day, but also during overnight wakefulness. More generally, these findings demonstrate a slow daily regulation of cortical excitation/inhibition balance, which depends on circadian-timing and prior sleep-wake history.},

Low-voltage-activated T-type calcium channels (T-channels), which activate with small membrane depolarizations, can generate burst firing and pacemaker activity. Here we have investigated the specific contribution to neuronal excitability of cloned human T-channel subunits. Using HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with the human a-1G (Cav3.1), a-1H (Cav3.2) and a-1I (Cav3.3) subunits, we describe significant differences among these isotypes in their biophysical properties, which are highlighted in action potential clamp studies. Firing activities occurring in cerebellar Purkinje neurons and in thalamocortical relay neurons used as voltage clamp waveforms revealed that a-1G channels and, to a lesser extent, a-1H channels produced large and transient currents, while currents related to a-1G channels exhibited facilitation and produced a sustained calcium entry associated with the depolarizing after-potential interval. Using simulations of reticular and relay thalamic neuron activities, we show that a-1I currents contributed to sustained electrical activities, while a-1G and a-1H currents generated short burst firing. Modelling experiments with the NEURON model further revealed that the a-1G channel and a-1I channel parameters best accounted for T-channel activities described in thalamocortical relay neurons and in reticular neurons, respectively. Altogether, the data provide evidence for a role of a-1I channel in pacemaker activity and further demonstrate that each T-channel pore-forming subunit displays specific gating properties that account for its unique contribution to neuronal firing.},

Indeed, the electrophysiology of the unconscious brain is characterized by well-defined thalamocortical rhythmicity. Here we address the ionic basis for such thalamocortical rhythms during unconsciousness. In particular, we address the role of CaV3.1 T-type Ca2+ channels, which are richly expressed in thalamic neurons. Toward this aim, we examined the electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes of mice lacking CaV3.1 channels (CaV3.1 knockout) during unconsciousness induced by ketamine or ethanol administration. Our findings indicate that CaV3.1 KO mice displayed attenuated low-frequency oscillations in thalamocortical loops, especially in the 1- to 4-Hz delta band, compared with control mice (CaV3.1 WT). Intriguingly, we also found that CaV3.1 KO mice exhibited augmented high-frequency oscillations during unconsciousness. In a behavioral measure of unconsciousness dynamics, CaV3.1 KO mice took longer to fall into the unconscious state than controls. In addition, such unconscious events had a shorter duration than those of control mice. The thalamocortical interaction level between mediodorsal thalamus and frontal cortex in CaV3.1 KO mice was significantly lower, especially for delta band oscillations, compared with that of CaV3.1 WT mice, during unconsciousness. These results suggest that the CaV3.1 channel is required for the generation of a given set of thalamocortical rhythms during unconsciousness. Further, that thalamocortical resonant neuronal activity supported by this channel is important for the control of vigilance states.},

	abstract = {1. Calcium currents were recorded with whole‐cell voltage‐clamp procedures in relay neurones of the rat thalamus which had been acutely isolated by an enzymatic dissociation procedure. 2. Low‐threshold and high‐threshold Ca2+ currents were elicited by depolarizing voltage steps from holding potentials more negative than ‐60 mV. A transient current, analogous to the T‐current in sensory neurones, was activated at low threshold near ‐65 mV and was completely inactivating at command steps up to ‐35 mV. Voltage steps to more depolarized levels activated a high‐threshold current that inactivated slowly and incompletely during a 200 ms step depolarization. 3. The high‐threshold current contained both non‐inactivating and slowly inactivating components which were insensitive and sensitive to holding potential, respectively. 4. A ‘T‐type' current was prominent in relay neurones, in both absolute terms (350 pA peak current average) and in relation to high‐threshold currents. The average ratio of maximum transient to maximum sustained current was greater than 2. 5. T‐current could be modelled in a manner analogous to that employed for the fast Na+ current underlying action potential generation, using the m3h format. The rate of activation of T‐current was voltage dependent, with a time constant (tau m) varying between 8 and 2 ms at command potentials of ‐60 to ‐10 mV at 23 degrees C. The rate of inactivation was also voltage dependent, and the time constant tau h varied between 50 and 20 ms over the same voltage range. With command potentials more positive than ‐35 mV, the inactivation of Ca2+ current could no longer be fitted by a single exponential. 6. Steady‐state inactivation of T‐current could be well fitted by a Boltzman equation with slope factor of 6.3 and half‐inactivated voltage of ‐83.5 mV. 7. Recovery from inactivation of T‐current was not exponential. The major component of recovery (70‐80\% of total) was not very voltage sensitive at potentials more negative than ‐90 mV, with tau r of 251 ms at ‐92 mV and 23 degrees C, compared to 225 ms at ‐112 mV. A smaller, voltage‐sensitive component accounted for the remainder of recovery. 8. All kinetic properties, including rates of activation, inactivation, and recovery from inactivation, as well as the amplitude of T‐current, were temperature sensitive with Q10 (temperature coefficient) values of greater than 2.5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) © 1989 The Physiological Society},

Different modes of interactions among the cells in this network underlie different states of consciousness, such as wakefulness and sleep. Interposed between the dorsal thalamus and cortex are the GABAergic neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), which play a pivotal role not only in switching between the awake and sleep states but also in sensory processing during the awake state. The visual, somatosensory, and auditory sectors of TRN share many of the same organizational features. Each of these sectors contains maps, which are related to its inputs and outputs, and organizational components called 'slabs.' It is proposed that, during wakefulness, TRN is crucially involved in resetting the activity levels in sensory nuclei of the dorsal thalamus, which allows the cortex to actively and periodically compare its ongoing sensory processing with the available sensory information.},

This top-down projection may allow the cortex to regulate sensory processing by modulating the excitability of thalamic cells. Layer 6 corticothalamic neurons monosynaptically excite thalamocortical cells, but also indirectly inhibit them by driving inhibitory cells of the thalamic reticular nucleus. Whether corticothalamic activity generally suppresses or excites the thalamus remains unclear. Here we show that the corticothalamic influence is dynamic, with the excitatory-inhibitory balance shifting in an activity-dependent fashion. During low-frequencyactivity, corticothalamic effects are mainly suppressive, whereas higher-frequency activity (even a short bout of gamma frequency oscillations) converts the corticothalamic influence to enhancement. The mechanism of this switching depends on distinct forms of short-term synaptic plasticity across multiple corticothalamic circuit components. Our results reveal an activity-dependent mechanism by which corticothalamic neurons can bidirectionally switch the excitability and sensory throughput of the thalamus, possibly to meet changing behavioral demands. The thalamus regulates sensory throughput to the neocortex, but the neocortex is also a major source of input to the thalamus. Crandall etal. reveal the dynamic mechanisms of cortical control over thalamic gating, providing a fresh framework for understanding this top-down pathway.},

	abstract = {The thalamic output during different behavioral states is strictly controlled by the firing modes of thalamocortical neurons. During sleep, their hyperpolarized membrane potential allows activation of the T-type calcium channels, promoting rhythmic high-frequency burst firing that reduces sensory information transfer. In contrast, in the waking state thalamic neurons mostly exhibit action potentials at low frequency (i.e., tonic firing), enabling the reliable transfer of incoming sensory inputs to cortex. Because of their nearly complete inactivation at the depolarized potentials that are experienced during the wake state, T-channels are not believed to modulate tonic action potential discharges. Here, we demonstrate using mice brain slices that activation of T-channels in thalamocortical neurons maintained in the depolarized/wake-like state is critical for the reliable expression of tonic firing, securing their excitability over changes in membrane potential that occur in the depolarized state. Our results establish a novel mechanism for the integration of sensory information by thalamocortical neurons and point to an unexpected role for T-channels in the early stage of information processing.

	abstract = {Neocortical and thalamic neurons are involved in the genesis of generalized spike-and-wave (SW) epileptic seizures. The cellular mechanism of SW involves complex interactions between intrinsic neuronal firing properties and multiple types of synaptic receptors, but because of the complexity of these interactions the exact details of this mechanism are unclear. In this paper these types of interactions were investigated by using biophysical models of thalamic and cortical neurons. It is shown first that, because of the particular activation properties of GABA(B) receptor-mediated responses, simulated field potentials can display SW waveforms if cortical pyramidal cells and interneurons generate prolonged discharges in synchrony, without any other assumptions. Here the 'spike' component coincided with the synchronous firing, whereas the 'wave' component was generated mostly by slow GABA(B)-mediated K+ currents. Second, the model suggests that intact thalamic circuits can be forced into a ∼3 Hz oscillatory mode by corticothalamic feedback. Here again, this property was attributable to the characteristics of GABA(B)-mediated inhibition. Third, in the thalamocortical system this property can lead to generalized ∼3 Hz oscillations with SW field potentials. The oscillation consisted of a synchronous prolonged firing in all cell types, interleaved with a ∼300 msec period of neuronal silence, similar to experimental observations during SW seizures. This model suggests that SW oscillations can arise from thalamocortical loops in which the corticothalamic feedback indirectly evokes GABA(B)-mediated inhibition in the thalamus. This mechanism is shown to be consistent with a number of different experimental models, and experiments are suggested to test its consistency.},

	abstract = {1. A network model of thalamocortical (TC) and thalamic reticular (RE) neurons was developed based on electrophysiological measurements in ferret thalamic slices. Single-compartment TC and RE cells included voltage- and calcium-sensitive currents described by Hodgkin-Huxley type of kinetics. Synaptic currents were modeled by kinetic models of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5- methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), γ-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA(A)) and GABA(B) receptors. 2. The model reproduced successfully the characteristics of spindle and slow bicuculline-induced oscillations observed in vitro. The characteristics of these two types of oscillations depended on both the intrinsic properties of TC and RE cells and their pattern of interconnectivity. 3. The oscillations were organized by the reciprocal recruitment between TC and RE cells, due to their mutual connectivity and bursting properties. TC cells elicited AMPA-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in RE cells, whereas RE cells elicited a mixture of GABA(A) and GABA(B) inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in TC cells. Because of the presence of a T current, sufficiently strong EPSPs could elicit a burst in RE cells, and TC cells could generate a rebound burst following GABAergic IPSPs. Under these conditions, interaction between the TC and RE cells produced sustained oscillations. 4. In the absence of spontaneous oscillation in any cell, the TC-RE network remained quiescent. Spindle oscillations with a frequency of 9-11 Hz could be initiated by stimulation of either TC or RE neurons. A few spontaneously oscillating TC neurons recruited the entire network model into a 'waxing-and-waning' oscillation. These 'initiator' cells could be an extremely small proportion of TC cells. 5. In intracellular recordings, TC cells display a reduced ability for burst firing after a sequence of bursts. The 'waning' phase of spindles was reproduced in the network model by assuming an activity- dependent upregulation of I(h) operating via a calcium-binding protein in TC cells, as shown previously in a two cell model. 6. Following the global suppression of GABA(A) inhibition, the disinhibited RE cells produced prolonged burst discharges that elicited strong GABA(B)-mediated currents in TC cells. The enhancement of slow IPSPs in TC cells was also due to cooperativity in the activation of GABA(B)-mediated current. These slow IPSPs recruited TC and RE cells into slower waxing-and-waning oscillations (3-4 Hz) that were even more highly synchronized. 7. Local axonal arborization of the TC to RE and RE to TC projections allowed oscillations to propagate through the network. An oscillation starting at a single focus induced a propagating wavefront as more cells were recruited progressively. The waning of the oscillation also propagated due to upregulation of I(h) in TC cells, leading to waves of spindle activity as observed in experiments. 8. The spatiotemporal properties of propagating waves in the model were highly dependent on the intrinsic properties of TC cells. The spatial pattern of spiking activity was markedly different for spindles compared with bicuculline-induced oscillations and depended on the rebound burst behavior of TC cells. The upregulation of I(h) produced a refractory period so that colliding spindle waves merged into a single oscillation and extinguished. Finally, reducing the I(h) conductance led to sustained oscillations. 9. Two key properties of cells in the thalamic network may account for the initiation, propagation, and termination of spindle oscillations, the activity-dependent upregulation of I(h) in TC cells, and the localized axonal projections between TC and RE cells. In addition, the model predicts that a nonlinear stimulus dependency of GABA(B) responses accounts for the genesis of prolonged synchronized discharges following block of GABA(A) receptors.},

Hodgkin-Huxley type kinetic models of ionic channels were derived from voltage- and current-clamp data from RE cells. Interactions between interconnected RE cells were simulated with the use of a kinetic model of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory synapses. 2. The intrinsic bursting properties of RE cells in the model were due to the presence of a low-threshold Ca2+ current and two Ca(2+)-activated currents. The properties of these model RE cells were compared with RE neurons recorded intracellularly in vivo in cats. 3. Model RE cells densely interconnected with GABAA synapses produced synchronous oscillations at a frequency close to that of spindles (7-14 Hz). Networks of RE neurons organized in a two-dimensional array with only proximal connectivity also exhibited synchronized oscillations in the spindle range. In addition, the proximally connected network showed periods of high and low synchronicity, giving rise to waxing and waning oscillations in the population of RE cells. 4. The spatiotemporal behavior of the network was investigated during waxing and waning oscillations. The waxing and waning emerged as an alternation between periods of desynchronized and synchronized activity, corresponding to periods of irregular and coherent spatial activity. During synchronized periods, the network displayed propagating coherent waves of synchronous activity that had a tendency to form spirals. 5. Networks of model RE neurons fully connected through GABAB synapses exhibited perfectly synchronous oscillations at lower frequencies (0.5-1 Hz), but two-dimensional networks with proximal GABAB connectivity failed to synchronize. 6. These simulations demonstrate that networks of model neurons that include the main intrinsic currents found in RE cells can generate waxing and waning oscillatory activity similar to the spindle rhythmicity observed in the isolated RE nucleus in vivo. The model reveals the interplay between the intrinsic rhythmic properties of RE cells and the fast synaptic interactions in organizing synchronized rhythmicity.},

	abstract = {Early studies have shown that spindle oscillations are generated in the thalamus and are synchronized over wide cortical territories. More recent experiments have shown that this large-scale synchrony depends on the integrity of corticothalamic feedback. Previously proposed mechanisms emphasized exclusively intrathalamic mechanisms to generate the synchrony of these oscillations. In the present paper, we propose a cellular mechanism in which the synchrony is dependent of a mutual interaction between cortex and thalamus. This cellular mechanism is tested by computational models consisting of pyramidal cells, interneurons, thalamic reticular (RE) and thalamocortical (TC) relay cells, on the basis of voltage-clamp data on intrinsic currents and synaptic receptors present in the circuitry. The model suggests that corticothalamic feedback must operate on the thalamus mainly through excitation of GABAergic RE neurons, therefore recruiting relay cells essentially through inhibition and rebound. We provide experimental evidence for such dominant inhibition in the lateral posterior nucleus. In these conditions, the model shows that conical discharges optimally evoked thalamic oscillations. This feature is essential to the present cellular mechanism and is also consistently observed experimentally. The model further shows that, with this type of corticothalamic feedback, conical discharges recruited large areas of the thalamus because of the divergent cortex-to-RE and RE-to- TC axonal projections. Consequently, the thalamocortical network generated patterns of oscillations and synchrony similar to in vivo recordings. The model also emphasizes the important role of the modulation of the I(h) current by calcium in TC cells. This property conferred a relative refractoriness to the entire network, a feature also observed experimentally, as we show here. Further, the same property accounted for various spatiotemporal features of oscillations, such as systematic propagation after low-intensity cortical stimulation, local oscillations, and more generally, a high variability in the patterns of spontaneous oscillations, similar to in vivo recordings. We propose that the large-scale synchrony of spindle oscillations in vivo is the result of thalamocortical interactions in which the corticothalamic feedback acts predominantly through the RE nucleus. Several predictions are suggested to test the validity of this model.},

We have investigated the intrinsic properties of RE cells using computational models based on morphological and electrophysiological data.

In a first series of experiments, the low- threshold calcium current (I(Ts)) was studied via voltage clamp in acutely dissociated RE cells that lack most of their dendrites. Simulations based on a cell with truncated dendrites and Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics reproduced these recordings with a relatively low density of I(Ts). In a second series of experiments, voltage-clamp recordings obtained in intact RE cells in slices showed a higher amplitude and slower kinetics of I(Ts). These properties could be reproduced from the reconstructed cell model assuming higher densities of I(Ts) in distal dendrites. In a third series of experiments, current-clamp recordings were obtained in RE cells in vivo. The marked differences with in vitro recordings could be reconciled by simulating synaptic bombardment in the dendrites of RE cells, but only if they contained high distal densities of I(Ts). In addition, simpler models with as few as three compartments could reproduce the same behavior assuming dendritic I(Ts). These models and experiments show how intrinsic bursting properties of RE cells, as recorded in vivo and in vitro, may be explained by dendritic calcium currents.},

Here we have combined in vitro recordings and computational modeling techniques to investigate the consequences of dendritically located I(T) in TC cells. Simulations of a reconstructed TC cell were compared with the recordings obtained in the same cell to constrain the values of its passive parameters. T-current densities in soma and proximal dendrites were then estimated by matching the model to voltage-clamp recordings obtained in dissociated TC cells, which lack most of the dendrites. The distal dendritic T-current density was constrained by recordings in intact TC cells, which show 5-14 times larger peak T-current amplitudes compared with dissociated cells. Comparison of the model with the recordings of the same cell constrained further the T-current density in dendrites, which had to be 4.5-7.6 times higher than in the soma to reproduce all experimental results. Similar conclusions were reached using a simplified three-compartment model. Functionally, the model shows that the same amount of T-channels can lead to different bursting behaviors if they are exclusively somatic or distributed throughout the dendrites. In conclusion, this combination of models and experiments shows that dendritic T-currents are necessary to reproduce low-threshold calcium electrogenesis in TC cells. Dendritic T-current may also have significant functional consequences, such as an efficient modulation of thalamic burst discharges by corticothalamic feedback.},

Here we have combined in vitro recordings and computational modeling techniques to investigate the consequences of dendritically located I(T) in TC cells. Simulations of a reconstructed TC cell were compared with the recordings obtained in the same cell to constrain the values of its passive parameters. T-current densities in soma and proximal dendrites were then estimated by matching the model to voltage-clamp recordings obtained in dissociated TC cells, which lack most of the dendrites. The distal dendritic T-current density was constrained by recordings in intact TC cells, which show 5-14 times larger peak T-current amplitudes compared with dissociated cells. Comparison of the model with the recordings of the same cell constrained further the T-current density in dendrites, which had to be 4.5-7.6 times higher than in the soma to reproduce all experimental results. Similar conclusions were reached using a simplified three-compartment model. Functionally, the model shows that the same amount of T-channels can lead to different bursting behaviors if they are exclusively somatic or distributed throughout the dendrites. In conclusion, this combination of models and experiments shows that dendritic T-currents are necessary to reproduce low-threshold calcium electrogenesis in TC cells. Dendritic T-current may also have significant functional consequences, such as an efficient modulation of thalamic burst discharges by corticothalamic feedback.},

	abstract = {To investigate the basis of the fluctuating activity present in neocortical neurons in vivo, we have combined computational models with whole-cell recordings using the dynamic-clamp technique. A simplified 'point-conductance' model was used to represent the currents generated by thousands of stochastically releasing synapses. Synaptic activity was represented by two independent fast glutamatergic and GABAergic conductances described by stochastic random-walk processes. An advantage of this approach is that all the model parameters can be determined from voltage-clamp experiments. We show that the point-conductance model captures the amplitude and spectral characteristics of the synaptic conductances during background activity. To determine if it can recreate in vivo-like activity, we injected this point-conductance model into a single-compartment model, or in rat prefrontal cortical neurons in vitro using dynamic clamp. This procedure successfully recreated several properties of neurons intracellularly recorded in vivo, such as a depolarized membrane potential, the presence of high-amplitude membrane potential fluctuations, a low-input resistance and irregular spontaneous firing activity. In addition, the point-conductance model could simulate the enhancement of responsiveness due to background activity. We conclude that many of the characteristics of cortical neurons in vivo can be explained by fast glutamatergic and GABAergic conductances varying stochastically. © 2001 IBRO.

Specifically, we focus on rhythms that rely on a particular excitability property, the postinhibitory rebound, an intrinsic cellular property that elicits transient membrane depolarization when released from hyperpolarization. Two distinct ionic currents can evoke this transient depolarization: a hyperpolarization-activated cation current and a low-threshold T-type calcium current. The presence of a slow activation is specific to the T-type calcium current and provides a slow positive feedback at the cellular level that is absent in the cation current. We show that this slow positive feedback is required to endow the network rhythm with physiological modulation and robustness properties. This study thereby identifies an essential cellular property to be retained at the network level in modeling network robustness and modulation.},

We investigated the mechanisms of this network control in a conductance-based population model that reliably switches between active and oscillatory mean-fields. Robust control of the mean-field properties relies critically on a switchable negative intrinsic conductance at the cellular level. This conductance endows circuits with a shared cellular positive feedback that can switch population rhythms on and off at a cellular resolution. The switch is largely independent from other intrinsic neuronal properties, network size and synaptic connectivity. It is therefore compatible with the temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity induced by slower regulatory functions such as neuromodulation, synaptic plasticity and homeostasis. Strikingly, the required cellular mechanism is available in all cell types that possess T-type calcium channels but unavailable in computational models that neglect the slow kinetics of their activation.},

	abstract = {Fifty years ago, FitzHugh introduced a phase portrait that became famous for a twofold reason: it captured in a physiological way the qualitative behavior of Hodgkin-Huxley model and it revealed the power of simple dynamical models to unfold complex firing patterns. To date, in spite of the enormous progresses in qualitative and quantitative neural modeling, this phase portrait has remained a core picture of neuronal excitability. Yet, a major difference between the neurophysiology of 1961 and of 2011 is the recognition of the prominent role of calcium channels in firing mechanisms. We show that including this extra current in Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics leads to a revision of FitzHugh-Nagumo phase portrait that affects in a fundamental way the reduced modeling of neural excitability. The revisited model considerably enlarges the modeling power of the original one. In particular, it captures essential electrophysiological signatures that otherwise require non-physiological alteration or considerable complexification of the classical model. As a basic illustration, the new model is shown to highlight a core dynamical mechanism by which calcium channels control the two distinct firing modes of thalamocortical neurons. © 2012 Drion et al.},

The specific architecture of the models is key to the tractability of their analysis: in spite of their high-dimensional and nonlinear nature, the model properties can be understood in terms of few canonical positive and negative feedback motifs localized in distinct timescales. We use this insight to shed light on a key problem in experimental neurophysiology, the challenge of understanding the sensitivity of neuronal behaviors to underlying parameters in empirically-derived models.

To reliably encode a wide range of signals, neurons need to achieve a broad range of firing frequencies and to move smoothly between low and high firing rates. This can be achieved with specific ionic currents, such as A-type potassium currents, which can linearize the frequency-input current curve. By applying recently developed mathematical tools to a number of biophysical neuron models, we show how currents that are classically thought to permit low firing rates can paradoxically cause a jump to a high minimum firing rate when expressed at higher levels. Consequently, achieving and maintaining a low firing rate is surprisingly difficult and fragile in a biological context. This difficulty can be overcome via interactions between multiple currents, implying a need for ion channel degeneracy in the tuning of neuronal properties.},

	abstract = {Thalamic neurons have been long assumed to fire in tonic mode during perceptive states, and in burst mode during sleep and unconsciousness. However, recent evidence suggests that bursts may also be relevant in the encoding of sensory information. Here, we explore the neural code of such thalamic bursts. In order to assess whether the burst code is generic or whether it depends on the detailed properties of each bursting neuron, we analyzed two neuron models incorporating different levels of biological detail. One of the models contained no information of the biophysical processes entailed in spike generation, and described neuron activity at a phenomenological level. The second model represented the evolution of the individual ionic conductances involved in spiking and bursting, and required a large number of parameters. We analyzed the models' input selectivity using reverse correlation methods and information theory. We found that n-spike bursts from both models transmit information by modulating their spike count in response to changes to instantaneous input features, such as slope, phase, amplitude, etc. The stimulus feature that is most efficiently encoded by bursts, however, need not coincide with one of such classical features. We therefore searched for the optimal feature among all those that could be expressed as a linear transformation of the time-dependent input current. We found that bursting neurons transmitted 6 times more information about such more general features. The relevant events in the stimulus were located in a time window spanning ∼100 ms before and ∼20 ms after burst onset. Most importantly, the neural code employed by the simple and the biologically realistic models was largely the same, implying that the simple thalamic neuron model contains the essential ingredients that account for the computational properties of the thalamic burst code. Thus, our results suggest the n-spike burst code is a general property of thalamic neurons.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives: Sleep slow-wave activity (SWA, electroencephalogram [EEG] power between 0.5 and 4.0 Hz) is homeostatically regulated, increasing with wakefulness and declining with sleep. Sleep SWA is thought to reflect sleep need, but the mechanisms of its homeostatic regulation remain unknown. Based on a recent hypothesis, we sought to determine whether a decrease in cortical synaptic strength can account for changes in sleep SWA. Design: A large-scale computer model of the sleeping thalamocortical system was used to reproduce in detail the cortical slow oscillations underlying EEG slow waves. Setting: N/A. Patients or Participants: N/A. Interventions: Simulated reductions in the strength of corticocortical synapses. Measurements and Results: Decreased synaptic strength led to (1) decreased single cell membrane potential oscillations and reduced network synchronization, (2) decreased rate of neural recruitment and decruitment, and (3) emergence of local clusters of synchronized activity. These changes were reflected in the local EEG as (1) decreased incidence of high-amplitude slow waves, (2) decreased wave slope, and (3) increased number of multipeak waves. Spectral analysis confirmed that these changes were associated with a decrease in SWA. Conclusions: A decrease in cortical synaptic strength is sufficient to account for changes in sleep SWA and is accompanied by characteristic changes in slow-wave parameters. Experimental results from rat cortical depth recordings and human high-density EEG show similar changes in slow-wave parameters with decreasing SWA, suggesting that the underlying mechanism may indeed be a net decrease in synaptic strength.},

	abstract = {Effective connectivity between cortical areas decreases during slow wave sleep. This decline can be observed in the reduced interareal propagation of activity evoked either directly in cortex by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or by sensory stimulation. We present here a large-scale model of the thalamocortical system that is capable of reproducing these experimental observations. This model was constructed according to a large number of physiological and anatomical constraints and includes over 30,000 spiking neurons interconnected by more than 5 million synaptic connections and organized into three cortical areas. By simulating the different effects of arousal promoting neuromodulators, the model can produce a waking or a slow wave sleep-like mode. In this work, we also seek to explain why intercortical signal transmission decreases in slow wave sleep. The traditional explanation for reduced brain responses during this state, a thalamic gate, cannot account for the reduced propagation between cortical areas. Therefore we propose that a cortical gate is responsible for this diminished intercortical propagation. We used our model to test three candidate mechanisms that might produce a cortical gate during slow wave sleep: a propensity to enter a local down state following perturbation, which blocks the propagation of activity to other areas, increases in potassium channel conductance that reduce neuronal responsiveness, and a shift in the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition toward inhibition, which decreases network responses to perturbation. Of these mechanisms, we find that only a shift in the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition can account for the observed in vivo response to direct cortical perturbation as well as many features of spontaneous sleep.

As one of the most inheritable sleep EEG signatures, sleep spindles probably reflect the strength and malleability of thalamocortical circuits that underlie individual cognitive profiles. We review the characteristics, organization, regulation and origins of sleep spindles and their implication in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) and its functions, focusing on human and rodent. Spatially, sleep spindle-related neuronal activity appears on scales ranging from small thalamic circuits to functional cortical areas, and generates a cortical state favoring intracortical plasticity while limiting cortical output. Temporally, sleep spindles are discrete events, part of a continuous power band, and elements grouped on an infraslow time scale over which NREMS alternates between continuity and fragility. We synthetize diverse and seemingly unlinked functions of sleep spindles for sleep architecture, sensory processing, synaptic plasticity, memory formation and cognitive abilities into a unifying sleep spindle concept, according to which sleep spindles a) generate neural conditions of large-scale functional connectivity and plasticity that outlast their appearance as discrete EEG events, b) appear preferentially in thalamic circuits engaged in learning and attention-based experience during wakefulness c) enable a selective re-activation and routing of wake-instated neuronal traces between brain areas such as hippocampus and cortex. Their fine spatiotemporal organization reflects NREMS as a physiological state coordinated over brain and body and may indicate, if not anticipate and ultimately differentiate, pathologies in sleep and neurodevelopmental, -degenerative and -psychiatric conditions.},

	abstract = {We highlight that the robustness and tunability of a bursting model critically rely on currents that provide slow positive feedback to the membrane potential. Such currents have the ability to make the total conductance of the circuit negative in a timescale that is termed “slow” because it is intermediate between the fast timescale of the spike upstroke and the ultraslow timescale of even slower adaptation currents. We discuss how such currents can be assessed either in voltage-clamp experiments or in computational models. We show that, while frequent in the literature, mathematical and computational models of bursting that lack the slow negative conductance are fragile and rigid. Our results suggest that modeling the slow negative conductance of cellular models is important when studying the neuromodulation of rhythmic circuits at any broader scale. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Nervous system functions rely on the modulation of neuronal activity between different rhythmic patterns. The mechanisms of this modulation are still poorly understood. Using computational modeling, we show the critical role of currents that provide slow negative conductance, distinct from the fast negative conductance necessary for spike generation. The significance of the slow negative conductance for neuromodulation is often overlooked, leading to computational models that are rigid and fragile.},

Geometrically, the condition imposes a transcritical bifurcation that rules the switch of excitability through the variation of a single physiological parameter. Our analysis of six different published conductance based models always finds the transcritical bifurcation and the associated switch in excitability, which suggests that the mathematical predictions have a physiological relevance and that a same regulatory mechanism is potentially involved in the excitability and signaling of many neurons. © 2013 Franci et al.},

We have examined the underlying mechanisms using whole-cell recordings from rat 1I stably expressed in HEK293 cells. We found several kinetic differences between 1G and 1I, including some properties that at first appear qualitatively different. Notably, 1I tail currents require two or even three exponentials, whereas 1G tails were well described by a single exponential over a wide voltage range. Also, closed-state inactivation is more significant for a-1I, even for relatively strong depolarizations. Despite these differences, gating of a-1I can be described by the same kinetic scheme used for a-1G, where voltage sensor movement is allosterically coupled to inactivation. Nearly all of the rate constants in the model are 5-12-fold slower for a-1I, but the microscopic rate for channel closing is fourfold faster. This suggests that T-channels share a common gating mechanism, but with considerable quantitative variability.},

Gamma-band (30-90 Hz) synchronization modulates excitation rapidly enough that it escapes the following inhibition and activates postsynaptic neurons effectively. Synchronization also ensures that a presynaptic activation pattern arrives at postsynaptic neurons in a temporally coordinated manner. At a postsynaptic neuron, multiple presynaptic groups converge, e.g., representing different stimuli. If a stimulus is selected by attention, its neuronal representation shows stronger and higher-frequency gamma-band synchronization. Thereby, the attended stimulus representation selectively entrains postsynaptic neurons. The entrainment creates sequences of short excitation and longer inhibition that are coordinated between pre- and postsynaptic groups to transmit the attended representation and shut out competing inputs. The predominantly bottom-up-directed gamma-band influences are controlled by predominantly top-down-directed alpha-beta-band (8-20 Hz) influences. Attention itself samples stimuli at a 7-8 Hz theta rhythm. Thus, several rhythms and their interplay render neuronal communication effective, precise, and selective.},

	abstract = {Memory is often defined as the mental capacity of retaining information about facts, events, procedures and more generally about any type of previous experience. Memories are remembered as long as they influence our thoughts, feelings, and behavior at the present time. Memory is also one of the fundamental components of learning, our ability to acquire any type of knowledge or skills. In the brain it is not easy to identify the physical substrate of memory. Basically, any long-lasting alteration of a biochemical process can be considered a form of memory, although some of these alterations last only a few milliseconds, and most of them, if taken individually, cannot influence our behavior. However, if we want to understand memory, we need to keep in mind that memory is not a unitary phenomenon, and it certainly involves several distinct mechanisms that operate at different spatial and temporal levels. One of the goals of theoretical neuroscience is to try to understand how these processes are orchestrated to store memories rapidly and preserve them over a lifetime. Theorists have mostly focused on synaptic plasticity, as it is one of the most studied memory mechanisms in experimental neuroscience and it is known to be highly effective in training artificial neural networks to perform real world tasks. Some of the synaptic plasticity models are purely phenomenological, some others have been designed to solve computational problems. In this article I will review some of these models and I will try to identify computational principles that underlie memory storage and preservation.},

Short memory lifetimes arise from the bounds that must be imposed on synaptic efficacy in any realistic model. We explored whether memory performance can be improved by allowing synapses to traverse a large number of states before reaching their bounds, or by changing the way these bounds are imposed. In the case of hard bounds, memory lifetimes grow proportional to the square of the number of synaptic states, but only if potentiation and depression are precisely balanced. Improved performance can be obtained without fine tuning by imposing soft bounds, but this improvement is only linear with respect to the number of synaptic states. We explored several other possibilities and conclude that improving memory performance requires a more radical modification of the standard model of memory storage. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

Most of the earlier studies focused on recordings in rodents and primates. More recently, significant advances have been made in this field of research through the analysis of basal ganglia field potentials recorded from implanted deep brain stimulation electrodes in the basal ganglia of human patients with Parkinson's disease and other disorders. It now appears that oscillatory activity may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. The most significant finding is that in Parkinson's disease synchronized oscillatory activity in the 10- to 35-Hz band (often termed β-band") is prevalent in the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits, and that such activity can be reduced by dopaminergic treatments. The entrainment of large portions of these circuits may disrupt information processing in them and may lead to parkinsonian akinesia (and perhaps tremor). Although less firmly established than the role of oscillations in movement disorders, oscillatory activities at higher frequencies may also be a component of normal basal ganglia physiology. © 2006 Movement Disorder Society.},

The contact points between an axon terminal of a neuron A and the dendrite of another neuron B are called synapses. The most important synapses are chemical synapses, but there exist also electrical synapses which we will not consider further. When an action potential of neuron A arrives at the axon terminating at a chemical synapse, a chemical signal (neurotransmit-ter) is ejected into the synaptic cleft and taken up by receptors sitting on the membrane of the dendrite of the receiving neuron. Upon transmitter binding, an ion channel opens, ions flow into the cell and cause a change in the proper-ties of neuron B. This change can be measured as an Excitatory or Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP or IPSP) at the soma of the receiving neuron (see Chapter 3). The strength of an excitatory synaptic connection can be quantified by the amplitude of the EPSP. The most important insight for all the rest of chapter is that the strength of a synapse is not fixed, but can change.},

	abstract = {A computational model of the rat subthalamic nucleus projection neuron is constructed using electrophysiological and morphological data and a restricted set of channel specifications. The model cell exhibits a wide range of electrophysiological behaviors characteristic of rat subthalamic neurons. It reveals that a key set of three channels play a primary role in distinguishing behaviors: a high-voltage-activated calcium channel (Cav1.2.-1.3), a low-voltage-activated calcium channel (Cav3.-), and a small current calcium-activated potassium channel (KCa2.1-2.3). Short and long posthyperpolarization rebound responses, low-frequency rhythmic bursting ({\textbackslash}textless1 Hz), higher-frequency rhythmic bursting (4-7 Hz), and slow action and depolarizing potentials are behaviors all mediated by the interaction of these channels. This interaction can generate a robust calcium-dependent extended depolarization in the dendrites (a depolarizing plateau). The diversity observed in the rat subthalamic physiology (such as short or long rebounds, or the presence of low-frequency rhythmic busting) can arise from alterations in both the density and distributions of these channel types and, consequently, their ability to generate this depolarizing plateau. A number of important predictions arise from the model. For example, blocking or disrupting the low-voltage-activated Cav3.- calcium current should mute the emergence of rebound responses and rhythmic bursting. Conversely, increasing this channel current via large hyperpolarizing potentials in combination with partial blockade of the high-voltage-activated calcium channels should lead to the more experimentally elusive in vitro high-frequency bursting.

Voltage dependence of peak Na conductance (g(Na)) is very similar in all cases, but activation kinetics in the gastropod neurons studied are markedly slower. Kinetic differences are very pronounced only over the voltage range spanned by the g(Na)-voltage relation. At positive and negative extremes of voltage, activation and deactivation kinetics of I(Na) are practically indistinguishable in all species studied. Voltage-dependent rate constants underlying activation of the slow type of Na channel found in gastropods thus appear to be much more voltage dependent than are the equivalent rates in the universally fast type of channel that predominates in cephalopods. Voltage dependence of inactivation kinetics shows a similar pattern and is representative of activation kinetics for the two types of Na channels. Neurons with fast Na channels can thus make much more rapid adjustments in the number of open Na channels at physiologically relevant voltages than would be possible with only slow Na channels. This capability appears to be an adaptation that is highly evolved in cephalopods, which are well known for their high-speed swimming behaviors. Similarities in slow and fast Na channel subtypes in molluscan and mammalian neurons are discussed.},

The LP neuron is part of the pyloric network, a central pattern generator that normally oscillates with a period of ∼ 1 s. We used the dynamic clamp to create artificial rhythmic synaptic inputs of various periods and duty cycles in the LP neuron. Surprisingly, we found that the strength of PIR increased slowly over multiple cycles of synaptic input. Moreover, this increased excitability persisted for 10-20 s after the rhythmic inhibition was removed. These effects are considerably slower than the rhythmic activity typically observed in LP. Thus this slow postinhibitory rebound allows the neuron to adjust its level of excitability to the average level of inhibition over many cycles, and is another example of an intrinsic "short-term memory" mechanism.

At the same time, neurons can be highly sensitive to neuro-modulators. We find correlates of this dual robustness and sensitivity in a global analysis of the structure of a conductance-based model neuron. We vary the maximal conductance parameters of the model neuron and, for each set of parameters tested, characterize the activity pattern generated by the cell as silent, tonically firing, or bursting. Within the parameter space of the five maximal conductances of the model, we find directions, representing concerted changes in multiple conductances, along which the basic pattern of neural activity does not change. In other directions, relatively small concurrent changes in a few conductances can induce transitions between these activity patterns. The global structure of the conductance-space maps implies that neuromodulators that alter a sensitive set of conductances will have powerful, and possibly state-dependent, effects. Other modulators that may have no direct impact on the activity of the neuron may nevertheless change the effects of such direct modulators via this state dependence.

	abstract = {The electrical characteristics of many neurons are remarkably robust in the face of changing internal and external conditions. At the same time, neurons can be highly sensitive to neuro-modulators. We find correlates of this dual robustness and sensitivity in a global analysis of the structure of a conductance-based model neuron. We vary the maximal conductance parameters of the model neuron and, for each set of parameters tested, characterize the activity pattern generated by the cell as silent, tonically firing, or bursting. Within the parameter space of the five maximal conductances of the model, we find directions, representing concerted changes in multiple conductances, along which the basic pattern of neural activity does not change. In other directions, relatively small concurrent changes in a few conductances can induce transitions between these activity patterns. The global structure of the conductance-space maps implies that neuromodulators that alter a sensitive set of conductances will have powerful, and possibly state-dependent, effects. Other modulators that may have no direct impact on the activity of the neuron may nevertheless change the effects of such direct modulators via this state dependence. Some of the results and predictions arising from the model studies are replicated and verified in recordings of stomatogastric ganglion neurons using the dynamic clamp.},

	abstract = {1. We address the hypothesis of Steriade and colleagues that the thalamic reticular nucleus (RE) is a pacemaker for thalamocortical spindle oscillations by developing and analyzing a model of a large population of all-to-all coupled inhibitory RE neurons. 2. Each RE neuron has three ionic currents: a low-threshold T-type Ca2+ current (ICa-T), a calcium-activated potassium current (IAHP) and a leakage current (IL). ICa-T underlies a cell's postinhibitory rebound properties, whereas IAHP hyperpolarizes the neuron after a burst. Each neuron, which is a conditional oscillator, is coupled to all other RE neurons via fast gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) and slow GABAB synapses. 3. For generating network oscillations IAHP may not be necessary. Synaptic inhibition can provide the hyperpolarization for deinactivating ICa-T that causes bursting if the reversal potentials for GABAA and GABAB synapses are sufficiently negative. 4. If model neurons display sufficiently powerful rebound excitability, an isolated RE network of such neurons oscillates with partial but typically not full synchrony. The neurons spontaneously segregate themselves into several macroscopic clusters. The neurons within a cluster follow the same time course, but the clusters oscillate differently from one another. In addition to activity patterns in which clusters burst sequentially (e.g., 2 or 3 clusters bursting alternately), a two-cluster state may occur with one cluster active and one quiescent. Because the neurons are all-to-all coupled, the cluster states do not have any spatial structure. 5. We have explored the sensitivity of such partially synchronized patterns to heterogeneity in cells' intrinsic properties and to simulated neuroelectric noise. Although either precludes precise clustering, modest levels of heterogeneity or noise lead to approximate clustering of active cells. The population-averaged voltage may oscillate almost regularly but individual cells burst at nearly every second cycle or less frequently. The active-quiescent state is not robust at all to heterogeneity or noise. Total asynchrony is observed when heterogeneity or noise is too large, e.g., even at 25\% heterogeneity for our reference set of parameter values. 6. The fast GABAA inhibition (with a reversal potential more negative than, say, -65 mV) favors the cluster states and prevents full synchrony. Our simulation results suggest two mechanisms that can fully synchronize the isolated RE network model. With GABAA removed or almost totally blocked, GABAB inhibition (because it is slow) can lead to full synchrony, which is partially robust to heterogeneity and noise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {1. The behavior of the mathematical model for the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG) developed in the previous paper was further studied. 2. The action of proctolin, a neuromodulatory peptide that acts directly on the LP neuron, was modeled. The effect of the proctolin-activated current (i(proc)) on the model neuron mimics the effects of proctolin on the isolated biological LP neuron. The depolarization and increased frequency of firing seen when i(proc) is activated are associated with changes in the relative contributions of the delayed rectifier (i(d)) and the Ca2+-activated outward current (i(o(Ca))) to the repolarization phase of the action potential. 3. The effects of turning off the A-current (i(A)) in the model were compared with those obtained by pharmacologically blocking i(A) in the biological neuron. i(A) appears to regulate action-potential frequency as well as postinhibitory rebound activity. 4. The role of i(A) on the rhythmic activity of the cell was studied by modifying several of its parameters while periodically activating a simulated synaptically activated conductance, i(syn). 5. The effects of manipulations of the maximal conductances (ḡ) for i(d) and i(o(Ca)) were studied. i(d) strongly influences action-potential frequency, whereas i(o(Ca)) strongly influences action-potential duration. 6. Modifications of the maximal conductance of the inward Ca2+ current (i(Ca)) were compared with the effects of blocking i(Ca) in the real cell. 7. The role of the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (i(h)) during ongoing rhythmic activity was assessed by periodically activating i(syn) while modifying i(h).},

If neuronal identity is associated with stereotypical function, as is the case in genetically identical neurons or in unambiguously identified individual neurons, this variability poses a conundrum: How is activity the same if the components that generate it - ionic current levels - are different? In some cases, ionic current variability across similar neurons generates an output gradient. However, many neurons produce very similar output activity, despite substantial variability in ionic conductances. It appears that, in many such cells, conductance levels of one ionic current vary in proportion to the conductance levels of another current. As a result, in a population of neurons, these conductances appear to be correlated. Here, I review theoretical and experimental work that suggests that neuronal ionic current correlation can reduce the global ionic current variability and can contribute to functional stability. © 2014 The Author(s) 2014.},

Plasticity is also essential for the maintenance of stable patterns of activity in the face of variable environmental and internal conditions. Previous theoretical and experimental results suggest that neurons stabilize their activity by altering the number or characteristics of ion channels to regulate their intrinsic electrical properties. We present both experimental and modeling evidence to show that activity-dependent regulation of conductances, operating at the level of individual neurons, can also stabilize network activity. These results indicate that the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab can generate a characteristic rhythmic pattern of activity in two fundamentally different modes of operation. In one mode, the rhythm is strictly conditional on the presence of neuromodulatory afferents from adjacent ganglia. In the other, it is independent of neuromodulatory input but relies on newly developed intrinsic properties of the component neurons.},

The Chay model showed coexisting period-1 and period-2 bursting patterns as a parameter and initial values are varied. We simulated multiple periodic and chaotic bursting patterns with non-(NS), burst phase (BS), spike phase (SS), complete (CS), and lag synchronization states. When the coexisting behavior is near period-2 bursting, the transitions of synchronization states of the coupled system follows very complex transitions that begins with transitions between BS and SS, moves to transitions between CS and SS, and to CS. Most initial values lead to the CS state of period-2 bursting while only a few lead to the CS state of period-1 bursting. When the coexisting behavior is near period-1 bursting, the transitions begin with NS, move to transitions between SS and BS, to transitions between SS and CS, and then to CS. Most initial values lead to the CS state of period-1 bursting but a few lead to the CS state of period-2 bursting. The BS was identified as chaos synchronization. The patterns for NS and transitions between BS and SS are insensitive to initial values. The patterns for transitions between CS and SS and the CS state are sensitive to them. The number of spikes per burst of non-CS bursting increases with increasing coupling strength. These results not only reveal the initial value- and parameter-dependent synchronization transitions of coupled systems with coexisting behaviors, but also facilitate interpretation of various bursting patterns and synchronization transitions generated in the nervous system with weak coupling strength.},

Most, possibly all, afferents reaching thalamus, ascending and cortical, are branches of axons that innervate lower (motor) centers, so that thalamocortical pathways can be viewed generally as monitors of ongoing motor instructions. In terms of numbers, the thalamic relay is dominated by synapses that modulate the relay functions. One of the roles of these modulatory pathways is to change the transfer of information through the thalamus, in accord with current attentional demands. Other roles remain to be explored.

We constructed a five-cell circuit in which a neuron is at the center of the circuit and the remaining neurons form two distinct oscillatory subnetworks. All neurons were modeled as modified Morris-Lecar models with a hyperpolarization-activated conductance (gh) in addition to calcium (gCa), potassium (gK), and leak conductances. We determined the effects of varying gCa, gK, and gh on the frequency, amplitude, and duty cycle of a single neuron oscillator. The frequency of the single neuron was highest when the gK and gh conductances were high and gCa was moderate whereas, in the traditional Morris-Lecar model, the highest frequencies occur when both gK and gCa are high. We randomly sampled parameter space to find 143 hub oscillators with nearly identical frequencies but with disparate maximal conductance, duty cycles, and burst amplitudes, and then embedded each of these hub neurons into networks with different sets of synaptic parameters. For one set of network parameters, circuit behavior was virtually identical regardless of the underlying conductances of the hub neuron. For a different set of network parameters, circuit behavior varied with the maximal conductances of the hub neuron. This demonstrates that neuromodulation of a single target neuron may dramatically alter the performance of an entire network when the network is in one state, but have almost no effect when the circuit is in a different state.},

	abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthlamic nucleus (STN) represents an effective treatment for medically refractory Parkinson's disease; however, understanding of its effects on basal ganglia network activity remains limited. We constructed a computational model of the subthalamopallidal network, trained it to fit in vivo recordings from parkinsonian monkeys, and evaluated its response to STN DBS. The network model was created with synaptically connected single compartment biophysical models of STN and pallidal neurons, and stochastically defined inputs driven by cortical beta rhythms. A least mean square error training algorithm was developed to parameterize network connections and minimize error when compared to experimental spike and burst rates in the parkinsonian condition. The output of the trained network was then compared to experimental data not used in the training process. We found that reducing the influence of the cortical beta input on the model generated activity that agreed well with recordings from normal monkeys. Further, during STN DBS in the parkinsonian condition the simulations reproduced the reduction in GPi bursting found in existing experimental data. The model also provided the opportunity to greatly expand analysis of GPi bursting activity, generating three major predictions. First, its reduction was proportional to the volume of STN activated by DBS. Second, GPi bursting decreased in a stimulation frequency dependent manner, saturating at values consistent with clinically therapeutic DBS. And third, ablating STN neurons, reported to generate similar therapeutic outcomes as STN DBS, also reduced GPi bursting. Our theoretical analysis of stimulation induced network activity suggests that regularization of GPi firing is dependent on the volume of STN tissue activated and a threshold level of burst reduction may be necessary for therapeutic effect. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Sleep is dividing into two states: Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep which is subdivided into three stages (N1, N2, N3); and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep characterized by rapid eye movements, muscle atonia and desynchronized EEG. Mammalian sleep and wake states are regulated by multiple neuronal systems located in the brainstem, diencephalon, and telencephalon. Wakefulness is maintained by activation of the ascending reticular activating system involving several neurotransmitters including glutamate, acetylcholine and the monoamines. NREM sleep onset is associated with a reduction in activation of the ascending reticular activating system and an increase in neural activity within the ventrolateral preoptic area, anterior hypothalamus and basal forebrain. REM sleep is triggered by activation of cholinergic neurons in the laterodorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei. The suppression of motor activity in REM sleep is generated by glutamate-mediated activation of descending medullary reticular formation. The two-process model postulates that a homeostatic process rises during waking and declines during sleep and interacts with a circadian process that is not directly dependent of sleep and waking. Sleep function remains controversial. Sleep is thought to be restorative, conservative, adaptive, thermoregulatory and memory consolidative functions. Sleep also serves host-defense mechanisms and conserves caloric expenditures. Emerging evidences indicated that sleep replenishes brain energy stores and that sleep serves a glymphatic function by removing toxic byproducts of waking activity. Finally, there is experimental evidence that connectivity changes with sleep, sleep loss, and with changing afferent input, and that those changes are linked to sleep regulatory mechanisms. Sleep medicine as a medical specialty has existed for more than 30 years. The study on over 90 kinds of sleep disorders has shed light on the understanding to the mechanisms of sleep. For example, the finding of the role of hypocretin/orexin in the patho-physiology of narcolepsy led to the reveal of hypocretin/orexin as a major wakefulness promoting substance. The evolution of the field will help us recognize the impact of sleep disorders on society as well as the nature of sleep itself.},

	abstract = {Mammals have evolved a range of behavioural and neurological mechanisms that coordinate cycles of thermoregulation and sleep. Whether diurnal or nocturnal, sleep onset and a reduction in core temperature occur together. Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep episodes are also accompanied by core and brain cooling. Thermoregulatory behaviours, like nest building and curling up, accompany this circadian temperature decline in preparation for sleeping. This could be a matter of simply comfort as animals seek warmth to compensate for lower temperatures. However, in both humans and other mammals, direct skin warming can shorten sleep-latency and promote NREM sleep. We discuss the evidence that body cooling and sleep are more fundamentally connected and that thermoregulatory behaviours, prior to sleep, form warm microclimates that accelerate NREM directly through neuronal circuits. Paradoxically, this warmth might also induce vasodilation and body cooling. In this way, warmth seeking and nesting behaviour might enhance the circadian cycle by activating specific circuits that link NREM initiation to body cooling. We suggest that these circuits explain why NREM onset is most likely when core temperature is at its steepest rate of decline and why transitions to NREM are accompanied by a decrease in brain temperature. This connection may have implications for energy homeostasis and the function of sleep.},

The LVA current component required negative potentials ({\textbackslash}textless-80 mV) to deinactivate completely, started to activate around -60 mV and reached a plateau level around -25 mV. It peaked within 30-6 ms and decayed with a single time constant of ∼ 24 ms at -20 mV. Its inactivation curve ranged from -100 to -40 mV, with a half-inactivation near -60 mV. The HVA current component could be isolated by holding the membrane potential positive to -60 mV, activated at potentials positive to -30 mV and peaked around +5 mV.

	abstract = {1. To perform simulations of the various modes of action potential generation in thalamic relay neurons, we developed Hodgkin-and-Huxley style mathematical equations that describe the voltage dependence and kinetics of activation and inactivation of four different currents, including the transient, low-voltage-activated Ca2+ current (IT), the rapidly inactivating transient K+ current (IA), the slowly inactivating K+ current (IK2), and the hyperpolarization-activated, mixed cationic current (Ih). The modeled currents were derived either from acutely dissociated rat thalamic relay neurons (IT, IA, IK2), or from guinea pig thalamic relay cells maintained in slices in vitro (Ih). 2. The voltage dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation of IT, IA, and IK2 and the activation of Ih could be modeled with Boltzmann-style equations. Modeling of the behavior of IT to depolarizing steps in voltage clamp required the use of the constant field equation to relate permeability to T-current amplitude. The time constant of activation of IT was described by a continuous bell-shaped function with a maximum near 15 ms at threshold for activation (-75 mV) and 23 degrees C. Mathematical description of the kinetics of inactivation and removal of inactivation of this current required two separate functions. 3. The rapidly activating and inactivating K+ current IA was modeled by assuming two components with different time constants of inactivation. The kinetics of activation was described as a continuous function of voltage with the slowest time constant, near 2.5 ms, at threshold for activation (-60 mV) and 23 degrees C. In contrast, the kinetics of inactivation of both components were described as voltage independent, consistent with experimental data. The rate or removal of inactivation of both components of IA was described as continuously increasing with the degree of hyperpolarization. 4. The slowly inactivating K+ current IK2 was also modeled by assuming two components with different rates of inactivation. The kinetics of activation were described by a bell-shaped function with a maximum time constant near 80 ms at -40 mV and 23 degrees C, whereas threshold for activation was approximately -60 mV. Inactivation of both components was modeled as relatively independent of voltage, whereas removal of inactivation was described as a continuous function of membrane potential. 5.

	abstract = {The inhibitory GABAergic projection of thalamic nucleus reticularis (nRt) neurons onto thalamocortical relay cells (TCs) is important in generating the normal thalamocortical rhythmicity of slow wave sleep, and may be a key element in the production of abnormal rhythms associated with absence epilepsy. Both TCs and nRt cells can generate prominent Ca(2+)-dependent low-threshold spikes, which evoke bursts of Na(+)-dependent fast spikes, and are influential in rhythm generation. Substantial differences in the pattern of burst firing in TCs versus nRt neurons led us to hypothesize that there are distinct forms of transient Ca2+ current (I(T)) underlying burst discharges in these two cell types. Using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, we analyzed I(T) in acutely isolated TCs and nRt neurons and found three key differences in biophysical properties. (1) The transient Ca2+ current in nRt neurons inactivated much more slowly than I(T) in TCs. This slow current is thus termed I(Ts). (2) The rate of inactivation for I(Ts) was nearly voltage independent. (3) Whole-cell I(Ts) amplitude was increased when Ba2+ was substituted for Ca2+ as the charge carrier. In addition, activation kinetics were slower for I(Ts) and the activation range was depolarized compared to that for I(T). Other properties of I(Ts) and I(T) were similar, including steady-state inactivation and sensitivities to blockade by divalent cations, amiloride, and antiepileptic drugs. Our findings demonstrate that subtypes of transient Ca2+ current are present in two different classes of thalamic neurons. The properties of I(Ts) lead to generation of long-duration calcium-dependent spike bursts in nRt cells. The resultant prolonged periods of GABA release onto TCs would play a critical role in maintaining rhythmicity by inducing TC hyperpolarization and promoting generation of low-threshold calcium spikes within relay nuclei.},

The analysis and modeling of the voltage dependence, kinetics, and reversal potentials of these four currents, I(T), I(A), I(K2), and I(h), predict that I(T) should provide the inward current for the generation of low-threshold Ca2+ spikes, with the rapidly activating and inactivating K+ current I(A) modulating the initial components of these Ca2+ spikes. In contrast, the slower kinetics of activation and inactivation of the K+ current I(K2) suggest that this current may affect more the later portions of low-threshold Ca2+ spikes. The properties of I(h) suggest that it is critical to modulation of the voltage-time course of the cell at hyperpolarized membrane potentials and may provide a 'pacemaker' potential for rhythmic burst generation.},

	abstract = {Somatosensory thalamocortical (TC) neurons from the ventrobasal (VB) thalamus are central components in the flow of sensory information between the periphery and the cerebral cortex, and participate in the dynamic regulation of thalamocortical states including wakefulness and sleep. This property is reflected at the cellular level by the ability to generate action potentials in two distinct firing modes, called tonic firing and low-threshold bursting. Although the general properties of TC neurons are known, we still lack a detailed characterization of their morphological and electrical properties in the VB thalamus. The aim of this study was to build biophysically-detailed models of VB TC neurons explicitly constrained with experimental data from rats. We recorded the electrical activity of VB neurons (N = 49) and reconstructed morphologies in 3D (N = 50) by applying standardized protocols. After identifying distinct electrical types, we used a multi-objective optimization to fit single neuron electrical models (e-models), which yielded multiple solutions consistent with the experimental data. The models were tested for generalization using electrical stimuli and neuron morphologies not used during fitting. A local sensitivity analysis revealed that the e-models are robust to small parameter changes and that all the parameters were constrained by one or more features. The e-models, when tested in combination with different morphologies, showed that the electrical behavior is substantially preserved when changing dendritic structure and that the e-models were not overfit to a specific morphology. The models and their analysis show that automatic parameter search can be applied to capture complex firing behavior, such as co-existence of tonic firing and low-threshold bursting over a wide range of parameter sets and in combination with different neuron morphologies.},

We present here a detailed large-scale thalamocortical model based on experimental measures in several mammalian species. The model spans three anatomical scales. (i) It is based on global (white-matter) thalamocortical anatomy obtained by means of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of a human brain. (ii) It includes multiple thalamic nuclei and six-layered cortical microcircuitry based on in vitro labeling and three-dimensional reconstruction of single neurons of cat visual cortex. (iii) It has 22 basic types of neurons with appropriate laminar distribution of their branching dendritic trees. The model simulates one million multicompartmental spiking neurons calibrated to reproduce known types of responses recorded in vitro in rats. It has almost half a billion synapses with appropriate receptor kinetics, short-term plasticity, and long-term dendritic spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (dendritic STDP). The model exhibits behavioral regimes of normal brain activity that were not explicitly built-in but emerged spontaneously as the result of interactions among anatomical and dynamic processes. We describe spontaneous activity, sensitivity to changes in individual neurons, emergence of waves and rhythms, and functional connectivity on different scales. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

	abstract = {The ionic requirements for electro-responsiveness in thalamic neurones were studied using in vitro slice preparations of the guinea-pig diencephalon. Analysis of the current-voltage relationship in these neurones revealed delayed and anomalous rectification. Substitution of Na+ with choline in the bath or addition of tetrodotoxin (TTX) abolished the fast spikes and the plateau potentials, described in the accompanying paper. Ca2+ conductance blockage with Co2+, Cd2+ or Mn2+, or replacement of Ca2+ by Mg2+ abolished the low-threshold spikes (l.t.s.). Substitution with Ba2+ did not significantly increase the duration of the l.t.s., suggesting that under normal conditions the falling phase of this response is brought about by inactivation of the Ca2+ conductance. The after-hyperpolarization (a.h.p.) following fast spikes was markedly reduced in amplitude and duration by bath application of Cd2+, Co2+ or Mn2+, indicating that a large component of this response is generated by a Ca2+-dependent K+ conductance (gK[Ca]). Following hyperpolarizing current pulses, the membrane potential showed a delayed return to base line. This delay is produced by a transient K+ conductance as it can be modified by changing the drive force for K+. Presumptive intra-dendritic recording demonstrated high-threshold Ca2+ spikes (h.t.s.s.) which activate a gK[Ca]. Such h.t.s.s. were also seen at the somatic level when K+ conductance was blocked with 4-aminopyridine. It is proposed that the intrinsic biophysical properties of thalamic neurones allow them to serve as relay systems and as single cell oscillators at two distinct frequencies, 9-10 and 5-6 Hz. These frequencies coincide with the alpha and theta rhythms of the e.e.g. and, in the latter case, with the frequency of Parkinson's tremor.},

	abstract = {The electroresponsive properties of guinea‐pig thalamic neurones were studied using an in vitro slice preparation. A total of 650 cells were recorded intracellularly comprising all regions of the thalamus; of these 229 fulfilled our criterion for recording stability and were used as the data base for this report. The resting membrane potential for thirty‐four representative neurones which were analysed in detail was ‐64 +/‐ 5 mV (mean +/‐ S.D.), input resistance 42 +/‐ 18 M omega, and action potential amplitude 80 +/‐ 7 mV. Intracellular staining with horseradish peroxidase and Lucifer Yellow revealed that the recorded cells had different morphology. In some their axonal trajectory characterized them as thalamo‐cortical relay cells. Two main types of neuronal firing were observed. From a membrane potential negative to ‐60 mV, anti‐ or orthodromic and direct activation generated a single burst of spikes, consisting of a low‐threshold spike (l.t.s.) of low amplitude and a set of fast superimposed spikes. Tonic repetitive firing was observed if the neurones were activated from a more positive membrane potential; this was a constant finding in all but two of the cells which fulfilled the stability criteria. The l.t.s. response was totally inactivated at membrane potentials positive to ‐55 mV. As the membrane was hyperpolarized from this level the amplitude of the l.t.s. increased and became fully developed at potentials negative to ‐70 mV. This increase is due to a de‐inactivation of the ionic conductance generating this response. After activation the l.t.s. showed refractoriness for approximately 170 ms. Deinactivation of l.t.s. is a voltage‐ and time‐dependent process; full de‐inactivation after a step hyperpolarization to maximal l.t.s. amplitude (‐75 to ‐80 mV) requires 150‐180 ms. Membrane depolarization positive to ‐55 mV generated sudden sustained depolarizing 'plateau potentials', capable of supporting repetitive firing (each action potential being followed by a marked after‐hyperpolarization, a.h.p.). The a.h.p. and the plateau potential controlled the voltage trajectory during the interspike interval and, with the fast spike, constitute a functional state where the thalamic neurone displayed oscillatory properties. Frequency‐current (f‐I) plots from different initial levels of membrane potential were obtained by the application of square current pulses of long duration (2s). From resting membrane potential and from hyperpolarized levels a rather stereotyped onset firing rate was observed due to the presence of the l.t.s.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) © 1984 The Physiological Society},

	abstract = {Song is a learned vocal behavior influenced by social interactions. Prior work has suggested that the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), a specialized pallial-basal ganglia circuit critical for vocal plasticity, mediates the influence of social signals on song. Here, we investigate the signals the AFP sends to song motor areas and their dependence on social context by characterizing singing-related activity of single neurons in the AFP output nucleus LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium). We show that interaction with females causes marked, real-time changes in firing properties of individual LMAN neurons. When males sing to females ("directed"), LMAN neurons exhibit reliable firing of single spikes precisely locked to song. In contrast, when males sing alone ("undirected"), the same LMAN neurons exhibit prominent burst firing and trial-by-trial variability. Burst structure and timing vary substantially across repeated undirected trials. Despite context-dependent differences in firing statistics, the average pattern of song-locked firing for an individual neuron is similar across behavioral contexts, suggesting a common underlying signal. Different LMAN neurons in the same bird, however, exhibit distinct firing patterns, suggesting that subsets of neurons jointly encode song features. Together, our findings demonstrate that behavioral interactions reversibly transform the signaling mode of LMAN neurons. Such changes may contribute to rapid switching of motor activity between variable and precise states. More generally, our results suggest that pallial-basal ganglia circuits contribute to motor learning and production through multiple mechanisms: patterned signals could guide changes in motor output while state-dependent variability could subserve motor exploration.

	abstract = {Contemporary brain research seeks to understand how cognition is reducible to neural activity. Crucially, much of this effort is guided by a scientific paradigm that views neural activity as essentially driven by external stimuli. In contrast, recent perspectives argue that this paradigm is by itself inadequate and that understanding patterns of activity intrinsic to the brain is needed to explain cognition. Yet, despite this critique, the stimulus-driven paradigm still dominates—possibly because a convincing alternative has not been clear. Here, we review a series of findings suggesting such an alternative. These findings indicate that neural activity in the hippocampus occurs in one of three brain states that have radically different anatomical, physiological, representational, and behavioral correlates, together implying different functional roles in cognition. This three-state framework also indicates that neural representations in the hippocampus follow a surprising pattern of organization at the timescale of ∼1 s or longer. Lastly, beyond the hippocampus, recent breakthroughs indicate three parallel states in the cortex, suggesting shared principles and brain-wide organization of intrinsic neural activity.},

Using dual intracellular recordings in vitro in monosynaptically connected pairs of PGN and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) neurons, we found that the functional effect of synaptic transmission between these cell types was strongly influenced by the membrane potential and hence the firing mode of both the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Activation of single action potentials or low-frequency spike trains in PGN or thalamocortical neurons resulted in the generation of PSPs that were 0.5-2.0 mV in amplitude. In contrast, the generation of Ca2+ spike-mediated bursts of action potentials in the presynaptic cell increased these PSPs to an average of 4.4 mV for the IPSP and 3.0 mV for the EPSP barrage, because of temporal summation and/or facilitation. If the postsynaptic neuron was at a resting membrane potential (e.g., - 65 mV), these PSP barrages could result in the activation of a low-threshold Ca2+ spike and burst of action potentials. These results demonstrate that the burst firing mode of action potential generation is a particularly effective means by which perigeniculate and thalamocortical neurons may influence one another. We propose that the activation of burst discharges in these cell types is essential for the generation of some forms of synchronized rhythmic oscillations of sleep and of epileptic seizures.},

The α1H and α1I currents activate and inactivate up to 1.5- and 5-fold slower, respectively. No differences in the voltage dependence of steady state inactivation are detected. Currents induced by expression of α1G and α1H deactivate with time constants of up to 6ms at a test potential of -80mV, but currents induced by α1I deactivate about three-fold faster. Recovery from short-term inactivation is more than three-fold slower for currents induced by α1H and α1I in comparison to α1G. In contrast to these characteristics, reactivation after long-term inactivation was fastest for currents arising from expression of α1I and slowest in cells expressing α1H calcium channels.

To explore the mechanism for STN burst firing in this setting, we augmented a previously published conductance-based computational model for single rat STN neurons to include both DIC and NMDA currents, fit to data from published electrophysiological recordings. Simulations show that with these additions, the model engages in bursting activity at \_1 Hz in response to hyperpolarizing current injection and that this bursting exhibits several features observed experimentally in STN. Furthermore, a reduced model is used to show that the combination of NMDA and DIC currents, but not either alone, suffices to generate oscillations under hyperpolarizing current injection. STN neurons show enhanced burstiness in Parkinson's disease patients and experimental models of parkinsonism, and the burst mechanism studied presently could contribute to this effect. © 2011 the American Physiological Society.},

We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the region of the subthalamic nuclei of eight patients with Parkinson's disease during the performance of a warned reaction time task in which an imperative cue instructed the subject to move or not to move. In 'go' trials, LFP activity in the beta frequency band (∼20 Hz) decreased prior to movement, with an onset latency that strongly correlated with mean reaction time across patients. This was followed by a late post-movement increase in beta power. In contrast, in 'nogo' trials the beta power drop following imperative signals was prematurely terminated compared with go trials and reversed into an early beta power increase. These differences were manifest as power increases when go trials were subtracted from nogo trials. In six patients these relative beta power increases in nogo-go difference trials were of shorter latency than the respective reaction time. The findings suggest that, firstly, the subthalamic nucleus is involved in the preparation of externally paced voluntary movements in humans and, secondly, the degree of synchronization of subthalamic nucleus activity in the beta band may be an important determinant of whether motor programming and movement initiation is favoured or suppressed.},

Expression of the cloned channel in either Xenopus oocytes or stably transfected human embryonic kidney-293 cells revealed novel gating properties. We compared these electrophysiological properties to those of the cloned T-type channels α1G and α1H and to the high voltage-activated channels formed by α1Eβ3. The α1I channels opened after small depolarizations of the membrane similar to α1G and α1H but at more depolarized potentials. The kinetics of activation and inactivation were dramatically slower, which allows the channel to act as a Ca2+ injector. In oocytes, the kinetics were even slower, suggesting that components of the expression system modulate its gating properties. Steady-state inactivation occurred at higher potentials than any of the other T channels, endowing the channel with a substantial window current. The α1I channel could still be classified as T-type by virtue of its criss-crossing kinetics, its slow deactivation (tail current), and its small (11 pS) conductance in 110 mM Ba2+ solutions. Based on its brain distribution and novel gating properties, we suggest that α1I plays important roles in determining the electroresponsiveness of neurons, and hence, may be a novel drug target.},

A key mediator of these effects is calmodulin, which has been found to bind the C-terminus of the pore-forming a subunit. In contrast, little is known about how Ca2+ i can regulate low voltage-activated T-type Ca2+ channels.Using whole cell patch clamp, we examined the biophysical properties of Ca2+ current through the three T-type Ca2+ channel isoforms, Cav3.1, Cav3.2, or Cav3.3, comparing internal solutions containing 27 nMand lmMfree Ca2+. Both activation and inactivation kinetics of Cav3.3 current in l mM Ca2+ i solution were more rapid than those in 27 nM Ca2+ i solution. In addition, both activation and steady-state inactivation curves of Cav3.3were negatively shifted in the higherCa2+ i solution. In contrast, the biophysical properties of Cav3.1 and Cav3.2 isoforms were not significantly different between the two internal solutions. Overexpression of CaM1234 (a calmodulin mutant that doesn't bind Ca2+) occluded the effects of l mMCa2+ i on Cav3.3, implying that CaM is involved in the Ca2+ i regulation effects on Cav3.3. Yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a direct interaction of CaM with the carboxyl terminus of Cav3.3. Taken together, our results suggest that Cav3.3 T-type channel is potently regulated by Ca2+ i via interaction of Ca2+/CaM with the carboxyl terminus of Cav3.3.},

Data reveal robust circadian dynamics of cortical excitability that are strongest in those individuals with highest endocrine markers of circadian amplitude. In addition, the time course of cortical excitability correlates with changes in EEG synchronization and cognitive performance.

At the network level, reactivations during sleep of neuronal assemblies recently challenged by new environmental circumstances have been reported in different experimental designs. These neuronal assemblies are proposed to be involved in the processing of memory traces during sleep. However, despite this rapidly growing body of experimental data, evidence for the influence of sleep discharge patterns on memory traces remains fragmentary. The underlying role of sleep in learning and memory has yet to be precisely characterized.},

Because neuromodulators can transform the intrinsic firing properties of circuit neurons and alter effective synaptic strength, neuromodulatory substances reconfigure neuronal circuits, often massively altering their output. Thus, the anatomical connectome provides a minimal structure and the neuromodulatory environment constructs and specifies the functional circuits that give rise to behavior. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

We show that similar neuronal and network outputs can be produced by a number of different combinations of ion channels and synapse strengths.

We argue that instead of trying to build a single model that captures the generic behavior of a neuron or circuit, it is beneficial to construct a population of models that captures the behavior of the population that provided the experimental data. Studying a population of models with different underlying structure and similar behaviors provides opportunities to discover unsuspected compensatory mechanisms that contribute to neuron and network function. © 2011 Nature America, Inc.

The effects of the various ionic currents on the electrophysiological properties of thalamocortical relay neurons were initially investigated through examining the effect of each current individually on passive membrane responses. The two leak currents, IKleak and INaleak, determined in large part the resting membrane potential and the apparent input resistance of the model neuron. Addition of IA resulted in a delay in the response of the model cell to a depolarizing current pulse, whereas addition of IK2, or IL combined with IC, resulted in a marked and prolonged decrease in the response to depolarization. Addition of Ih resulted in a depolarizing "sag" in response to hyperpolarization, whereas addition of IT resulted in a large rebound Ca2+ spike after hyperpolarization. Finally, addition of INap resulted in enhancement of depolarization. 3. The low-threshold Ca2+ spike of rodent neurons was successfully modeled with the active currents I(T), IL, IA, IC, and IK2. The low-threshold Ca2+ current I(T) generated the low-threshold Ca2+ spike.

Specific alterations in the interactions between these cells can result in the generation of paroxysmal events resembling absence seizures in children. The release of several different neurotran smitters from the brain stem, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, and cerebral cortex results in a depolarization of thalamocortical and thalamic reticular neurons and an enhanced excitability in many cortical pyramidal cells, thereby suppressing the generation of sleep rhythms and promoting a state that is conducive to sensory processing and cognition.},

One common theme in the generation of rhythms is the interaction of a positive feedback loop (e.g., recurrent excitation) with negative feedback control (e.g., inhibition, adaptation, or synaptic depression). The operation of these state-dependent activities has wide ranging effects from enhancing or blocking sensory-motor processing to the generation of pathological rhythms associated with psychiatric or neurological disorders.},

These variations contribute to the apparent noisiness of sensory responses at both the neural and the behavioral level. Recent investigations of rapid state changes in awake, behaving animals have provided insight into the mechanisms by which optimal sensory encoding and behavioral performance are achieved. Fluctuations in state, as indexed by pupillometry, impact both the "signal" (sensory evoked response) and the "noise" (spontaneous activity) of cortical responses. By taking these fluctuations into account, neural response (co)variability is significantly reduced, revealing the brain to be more reliable and predictable than previously thought. The waking brain appears to be noisy, giving rise to variable responses. McGinley et al. review literature that reveals the careful monitoring of waking can control for these variations and reveal a brain that is both reliable and predictable.},

We report here the molecular cloning and functional expression of three members of the low voltage-activated calcium channel family from rat brain (α1G, α1H, and α1I). Northern blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses show α1G, α1H, and α1I to be expressed throughout the newborn and juvenile rat brain. In contrast, while α1G and α1H mRNA are expressed in all regions in adult rat brain, α1I mRNA expression is restricted to the striatum. Expression of α1G, α1H, and α1I subunits in HEK293 cells resulted in calcium currents with typical T-type channel characteristics: low voltage activation, negative steady-state inactivation, strongly voltage-dependent activation and inactivation, and slow deactivation. In addition, the direct electrophysiological comparison of α1G, α1H, and α1I under identical recording conditions also identified unique characteristics including activation and inactivation kinetics and permeability to divalent cations. Simulation of α1G, α1H, and α 1I T-type channels in a thalamic neuron model cell produced unique firing patterns (burst versus tonic) typical of different brain nuclei and suggests that the three channel types make distinct contributions to neuronal physiology.},

Here we describe a novel type of cardiac Ca channel with several properties that distinguish it from the hitherto-identified Ca channel in heart cells. Its conductance in isotonic Ba is small (8 pS), and is no larger in Ba than in Ca. It activates and inactivates at relatively negative potentials and remains functional long after patch excision. It is insensitive to dihydropyridines such as nimodipine and the Ca agonist Bay K 8644, and is more resistant to block by external Cd than the previously described type of cardiac Ca channel. © 1985 Nature Publishing Group.},

The correlations depend on the relative rates of expression of different conductances. Thus, variability is consistent with homeostatic regulation and the structure of this variability reveals quantitative relations between regulation dynamics of different conductances. Furthermore, we show that homeostatic regulation is remarkably insensitive to the details that couple the regulation of a given conductance to overall neuronal activity because of degeneracy in the function of multiple conductances and can be robust to "antihomeostatic" regulation of a subset of conductances expressed in a cell.},

Our approach is based on the implicit function theorem and is applicable to activity characteristics that smoothly depend on parameters. Such smoothness is often intrinsic to neuronal systems when they are in stable functional states. The conclusions about how parameters compensate each other, developed in this study, can thus be used even without regard to the specific mathematical model describing a particular neuron or neuronal network. We showed that near a generic point in the parameter space there are infinitely many other points, or parameter combinations, for which specified characteristics of activity are the same as in the original point. These parameter combinations form a smooth manifold. This manifold can be extended as long as the gradients of characteristics are defined and independent. All possible variations of parameters compensating each other are simply all possible charts of the same manifold. The number of compensating parameters (but not parameters themselves) is fixed and equal to the number of the independent characteristics maintained. The algorithm that we developed shows how to find compensatory functional dependencies between parameters numerically. Our method can be used in the analysis of the homeostatic regulation, neuronal database search, model tuning and other applications. Copyright © 2007 The American Physiological Society.},

	abstract = {Because the subthalamic nucleus (STN) acts as a driving force of the basal ganglia, it is important to know how the activities of STN neurons are regulated. Previously, we have reported that a subset of STN neurons generates a plateau potential in a voltage-dependent manner. These plateau potentials can be evoked only when the cell is hyperpolarized. Here, to examine the mechanism of the voltage-dependent generation of the plateau potential in STN neurons, we constructed a conductance-based model of the plateau-generating STN neuron based on experimental observations and compared simulation results with recordings in slices. The model consists of a single compartment containing a Na+ current, a delayed-rectifier K+ current, an A-type K+ current, an L-like long-lasting Ca2+ current, a T-type Ca 2+ current, a Ca2+-dependent K+ current, and a leak current. Our simulation results showed that a plateau potential in the model could be induced in a voltage-dependent manner that depended on the inactivation properties of L-like long-lasting Ca2+ current. The model could also reproduce the generation of a plateau potential as a rebound potential after termination of hyperpolarizing current injection. In addition, we tested the stability of simulated plateau potentials against inhibitory perturbation and found that the model showed similar properties observed for the plateau potentials of STN neurons in slices. The effects of K+ channel blockade by TEA and intracellular Ca2+ ion chelation by BAPTA on the plateau duration were also tested in the model and were found to match experimental observations. Thus our STN neuron model could qualitatively reproduce a number of experimental observations on plateau potentials. Our results suggest that the inactivation of L-type Ca2+ channels plays an important role in the voltage-dependent generation of the plateau potential.},

To address this question, a series of chimeric channels between Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 channels were constructed and expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Kinetic analysis showed that the slow activation and inactivation kinetics of the Cav3.3 channel were not completely abolished by substitution with any one portion of the Cav3.1 channel.

The complex interplay of ionic conductances within the thalamo-reticular-cortical network give rise to these multiple modes of activity and a rapid transition exists between these modes. To better understand this transition, we constructed a simplified computational model based on physiological recordings and physiologically realistic parameters of a three-neuron network containing a thalamocortical cell, a thalamic reticular neuron, and a corticothalamic cell. The network can assume multiple states of oscillatory activity, resembling sleep, wakefulness, and the transition between these two. We found that during the transition period, but not during other states, thalamic and cortical neurons displayed chaotic dynamics, based on the presence of strange attractors, estimation of positive Lyapunov exponents and the presence of a fractal dimension in the spike trains. These dynamics were quantitatively dependent on certain features of the network, such as the presence of corticothalamic feedback and the strength of inhibition between the thalamic reticular nucleus and thalamocortical neurons. These data suggest that chaotic dynamics facilitate a rapid transition between sleep and wakefulness and produce a series of experimentally testable predictions to further investigate the events occurring during the sleep-wake transition period.},

	abstract = {T-type Ca2+ channels were originally called low-voltage-activated (LVA) channels because they can be activated by small depolarizations of the plasma membrane. In many neurons Ca2+ influx through LVA channels triggers low-threshold spikes, which in turn triggers a burst of action potentials mediated by Na+ channels. Burst firing is thought to play an important role in the synchronized activity of the thalamus observed in absence epilepsy, but may also underlie a wider range of thalamocortical dysrhythmias. In addition to a pacemaker role, Ca2+ entry via T-type channels can directly regulate intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, which is an important second messenger for a variety of cellular processes. Molecular cloning revealed the existence of three T-type channel genes. The deduced amino acid sequence shows a similar four-repeat structure to that found in high-voltage-activated (HVA) Ca2+ channels, and Na+ channels, indicating that they are evolutionarily related. Hence, the α1-subunits of T-type channels are now designated Cav3. Although mRNAs for all three Cav3 subtypes are expressed in brain, they vary in terms of their peripheral expression, with Cav3.2 showing the widest expression. The electrophysiological activities of recombinant Cav3 channels are very similar to native T-type currents and can be differentiated from HVA channels by their activation at lower voltages, faster inactivation, slower deactivation, and smaller conductance of Ba2+. The Cav3 subtypes can be differentiated by their kinetics and sensitivity to block by Ni2+. The goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive description of T-type currents, their distribution, regulation, pharmacology, and cloning.},

To obtain models as generic as possible, we used data from different preparations in vivo and in vitro, such as rat somatosensory cortex and thalamus, guinea-pig visual and frontal cortex, ferret visual cortex, cat visual cortex and cat association cortex.

	abstract = {Sleep and circadian rhythms are regulated across multiple functional, spatial and temporal levels: from genes to networks of coupled neurons and glial cells, to large scale brain dynamics and behaviour. The dynamics at each of these levels are complex and the interaction between the levels is even more so, so research have mostly focused on interactions within the levels to understand the underlying mechanisms—the so-called reductionist approach. Mathematical models were developed to test theories of sleep regulation and guide new experiments at each of these levels and have become an integral part of the field. The advantage of modelling, however, is that it allows us to simulate and test the dynamics of complex biological systems and thus provides a tool to investigate the connections between the different levels and study the system as a whole. In this paper I review key models of sleep developed at different physiological levels and discuss the potential for an integrated systems biology approach for sleep regulation across these levels. I also highlight the necessity of building mechanistic connections between models of sleep and circadian rhythms across these levels.},

In contrast, increasing the duration of the synaptic conductance pulses always led to changes in the burst period, indicating that neural oscillators are sensitive to changes in the duration of synaptic input but are not sensitive to changes in the strength of synaptic inputs above a certain conductance. This saturation of the response to progressively stronger synaptic inputs occurs not only in bursting neurons but also in tonically spiking neurons. We identified inward currents at hyperpolarized potentials as the cause of the saturation in the model neuron.

	abstract = {Thalamic relay cells fire in two distinct modes, burst or tonic, and the operative mode is dictated by the inactivation state of low-threshold, voltage-gated, transient (or T-type) Ca2+ channels. Tonic firing is seen when the T channels are inactivated via membrane depolarization, and burst firing is seen when the T channels are activated from a hyperpolarized state. These response modes have very different effects on the relay of information to the cortex. It had been thought that only tonic firing is seen in the awake, alert animal, but recent evidence from several species suggests that bursting may also occur. We have begun to explore this issue in macaque monkeys by recording from thalamic relay cells of unanesthetized, behaving animals. In the lateral geniculate nucleus, the thalamic relay for retinal information, we found that tonic mode dominated responses both during alert behavior as well as during sleep. We nonetheless found burst firing present during the vigilant, waking state. There was, however, considerably more burst mode firing during sleep than wakefulness. Surprisingly, we did not find the bursting during sleep to be rhythmic. We also recorded from relay cells of the somatosensory thalamus. Interestingly, not only did these somatosensory neurons exhibit much more burst mode activity than did geniculate cells, but bursting during sleep was highly rhythmic. It thus appears that the level and nature of relay cell bursting may not be constant across all thalamic nuclei.},

	abstract = {Over more than a century of research has established the fact that sleep benefits the retention of memory. In this review we aim to comprehensively cover the field of "sleep and memory" research by providing a historical perspective on concepts and a discussion of more recent key findings. Whereas initial theories posed a passive role for sleep enhancing memories by protecting them from interfering stimuli, current theories highlight an active role for sleep in which memories undergo a process of system consolidation during sleep. Whereas older research concentrated on the role of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, recent work has revealed the importance of slow-wave sleep (SWS) for memory consolidation and also enlightened some of the underlying electrophysiological, neurochemical, and genetic mechanisms, as well as developmental aspects in these processes. Specifically, newer findings characterize sleep as a brain state optimizing memory consolidation, in opposition to the waking brain being optimized for encoding of memories. Consolidation originates from reactivation of recently encoded neuronal memory representations, which occur during SWS and transform respective representations for integration into long-term memory. Ensuing REM sleep may stabilize transformed memories. While elaborated with respect to hippocampus-dependent memories, the concept of an active redistribution of memory representations from networks serving as temporary store into long-term stores might hold also for non-hippocampus-dependent memory, and even for nonneuronal, i.e., immunological memories, giving rise to the idea that the offline consolidation of memory during sleep represents a principle of long-term memory formation established in quite different physiological systems. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.},

Properties of voltage-dependent Na+ currents were investigated in forty-two dentate granule cells (DGCs) acutely isolated from the resected hippocampus of twenty patients with therapy-refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. 2. Depolarizing voltage commands elicited large, rapidly activating and inactivating Na+ currents (140 pS μm-2 163 mM extracellular Na+) that were reduced in amplitude by lowering the Na+ gradient (43 mM extracellular Na+). At low temperatures (8-12°C), the time course of Na+ currents slowed and could be well described by the model of Hodgkin and Huxley. 3. Na+ currents were reversibly blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX) and saxitoxin (STX) with a half-maximal block of 4.7 and 2.6 nM, respectively. In order to reduce series resistance errors, the Na+ current was partially blocked by low toxin concentrations (10-15 nM) in the experiments described below. Under these conditions, Na+ currents showed a threshold of activation of about -50 mV, and the voltages of half-maximal activation and inactivation were -29 and -55 mV, respectively. 4. The time course of recovery from inactivation could be described with a double-exponential function (time constants, 3-20 and 60-200 ms). The rapid and slow time constants showed a distinct voltage dependence with maximal values around -55 and -80 mV, respectively. These properties contributed to a reduction of the Na+ currents during repetitive stimulation that was more pronounced with higher stimulation frequencies and also showed a dependence on the holding potential. 5. In summary the most striking features of DGC Na+ currents were the large current density and the presence of a current component showing a slow recovery from inactivation. Our data provide a basis for comparison with properties of Na+ currents in animal models of epilepsy, and for the study of drug actions in therapy-refractory epilepsy.},

	abstract = {It is well established that the main intrinsic electrophysiological properties of thalamocortical relay cells, production of a low threshold burst upon release from hyperpolarized potential and production of a train of single spikes following stimulation from depolarized potentials, can be readily modelled using a single compartment. There is, however, another less well explored intrinsic electrophysiological characteristic of relay cells for which models have not yet accounted: at somatic potentials near spike threshold, relay cells produce a fast ragged high threshold oscillation in somatic voltage. Optical [Ca2+] imaging and pharmacological tests indicate that this oscillation correlates with a high threshold Ca2+ current in the dendrites. Here we present the development of a new compartment model of the thalamic relay cell guided by the simultaneous constraints that it must produce the familiar regular spiking relay mode and low threshold rebound bursts which characterize these cells, as well as the less-studied fast oscillation occurring at near-threshold somatic potentials. We arrive at a model cell which is capable of the production of isolated high threshold Ca2+ spikes in distal branch segments, driven by a rapidly inactivating intermediate threshold Ca2+ channel. Further, the model produces the low threshold spike behaviour of the relay cell without requiring high T-current density in the distal dendritic segments. The results thus support a new picture of the dendritic tree of relay cells which may have implications for the manner in which thalamic relay cells integrate descending input from the cortex. © The Physiological Society 2004.},

This circuit reliably produces a stereotyped fictive pattern of activity and has been extensively characterized. Here we determined, as quantitatively as possible, the strength of each inhibitory synapse and electrical junction within the core circuit of the heartbeat CPG. We also examined the animal-to-animal variability in strengths of these connections and, for some, determined the correlations between connections to the same postsynaptic target. The core CPG is composed of seven bilateral pairs of heart interneurons connected via both inhibitory chemical synapses and electrical junctions. Fifteen different connections within the core CPG were measured for strength using extracellular presynaptic recordings and postsynaptic voltage-clamp recordings across a minimum of seven individuals each, and the animal-to-animal variability was characterized. Connection strengths within the core network varied three to more than sevenfold among individuals (depending on the specific connection). The balance between two inputs onto various postsynaptic targets was explored by within-individual comparisons and correlation across individuals. Of the seven comparisons made within the core CPG, three showed a clear correlation of connection strengths, while the other four did not. We conclude that the leech heartbeat CPG can withstand wide variability in connection strengths and still produce stereotyped output. The network appears to preserve the relative strengths of some pairs of inputs, despite the animal-toanimal variability. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.},

	abstract = {Background: Although they form a unitary phenomenon, the relationship between extracranial M/EEG and transmembrane ion flows is understood only as a general principle rather than as a well-articulated and quantified causal chain. Method: We present an integrated multiscale model, consisting of a neural simulation of thalamus and cortex during stage N2 sleep and a biophysical model projecting cortical current densities to M/EEG fields. Sleep spindles were generated through the interactions of local and distant network connections and intrinsic currents within thalamocortical circuits. 32,652 cortical neurons were mapped onto the cortical surface reconstructed from subjects' MRI, interconnected based on geodesic distances, and scaled-up to current dipole densities based on laminar recordings in humans. MRIs were used to generate a quasi-static electromagnetic model enabling simulated cortical activity to be projected to the M/EEG sensors. Results: The simulated M/EEG spindles were similar in amplitude and topography to empirical examples in the same subjects. Simulated spindles with more core-dominant activity were more MEG weighted. Comparison with existing methods: Previous models lacked either spindle-generating thalamic neural dynamics or whole head biophysical modeling; the framework presented here is the first to simultaneously capture these disparate scales. Conclusions: This multiscale model provides a platform for the principled quantitative integration of existing information relevant to the generation of sleep spindles, and allows the implications of future findings to be explored. It provides a proof of principle for a methodological framework allowing large-scale integrative brain oscillations to be understood in terms of their underlying channels and synapses.},

Using a computational model, this paper considers the hypothesis that DBS works by replacing pathologically rhythmic basal ganglia output with tonic, high frequency firing. In our simulations of parkinsonian conditions, rhythmic inhibition from GPi to the thalamus compromises the ability of thalamocortical relay (TC) cells to respond to depolarizing inputs, such as sensorimotor signals. High frequency stimulation of STN regularizes GPi firing, and this restores TC responsiveness, despite the increased frequency and amplitude of GPi inhibition to thalamus that result. We provide a mathematical phase plane analysis of the mechanisms that determine TC relay capabilities in normal, parkinsonian, and DBS states in a reduced model. This analysis highlights the differences in deinactivation of the low-threshold calcium T-current that we observe in TC cells in these different conditions. Alternative scenarios involving convergence of thalamic signals in the cortex are also discussed, and predictions associated with these results, including the occurrence of rhythmic rebound bursts in certain TC cells in parkinsonian states and their drastic reduction by DBS, are stated. These results demonstrate how DBS could work by increasing firing rates of target cells, rather than shutting them down. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

We employ bifurcation analysis to illustrate the stimulus-response behavior of the full model under both voltage regimes. The model neuron shows continuous sodium spiking when depolarized sufficiently from rest. Depending on the parameters of calcium current inactivation, there are two types of low-voltage responses to a hyperpolarizing current step: a single rebound low threshold spike (LTS) upon release of the step and periodic LTSs. Bursting is seen as sodium spikes ride the LTS crest. In both cases, we analyze the LTS burst response by projecting its trajectory into a fast/slow phase plane. We also use phase plane methods to show that a potassium A-current shifts the threshold for sodium spikes, reducing the number of fast sodium spikes in an LTS burst. It can also annihilate periodic bursting. We extend the previous work of Rose and Hindmarsh (1989a–c) for a thalamic neuron and propose a simpler model for thalamic activity. We consider burst modulation by using a neuromodulator-dependent potassium leakage conductance as a control parameter.

The present paper describes models of single respiratory neurons that have been used as the elements in our network models of the central respiratory pattern generator presented in subsequent papers. The models of respiratory neurons were developed in the Hodgkin-Huxley style employing both physiological and biophysical data obtained from brain stem neurons in mammals. Two single respiratory neuron models were developed to match the two distinct firing behaviors of respiratory neurons described in vive: neuron type I shows an adapting firing pattern in response to synaptic excitation, and neuron type II shows a ramp firing pattern during membrane depolarization after a period of synaptic inhibition. We found that a frequency ramp firing pattern can result from intrinsic membrane properties, specifically from the combined influence of calcium-dependent K(AHP)(Ca), low-threshold Ca(T) and K(A) channels. The neuron models with these ionic channels (type II) demonstrated ramp firing patterns similar to those recorded from respiratory neurons in vive. Our simulations show that K(AHP)(Ca) channels in combination with high-threshold Ca(L) channels produce spike frequency adaptation during synaptic excitation. However, in combination with low-threshold Ca(T) channels, they cause a frequency ramp firing response after release from inhibition. This promotes a testable hypothesis that the main difference between the respiratory neurons that adapt (for example, early inspiratory, postinspiratory, and decrementing expiratory) and those that show ramp firing patterns (for example, ramp inspiratory and augmenting expiratory) consists of a ratio between the two types of calcium channels: Ca(L) channels predominate in the former and Ca(T) channels in the latter respiratory neuron types. We have analyzed the dependence of adapting and ramp firing patterns on maximal conductances of different ionic channels and values of synaptic drive. The effect of adjusting specific membrane conductances and synaptic interactions revealed plausible neuronal mechanisms that may underlie modulatory effects on respiratory neuron firing patterns and network performances. The results of computer simulation provide useful insight into functional significance of specific intrinsic membrane properties and their interactions with phasic synaptic inputs for a better understanding of respiratory neuron firing behavior.},

Nonetheless, the activation range between high-voltage (HVA) and low-voltage (LVA) activated calcium channels is around 30–40 mV apart, despite the high level of amino acid similarity within their S4 segments. To investigate the contribution of S4 voltage sensors for the low-voltage activation characteristics of CaV3.3 channels we constructed chimeras by swapping S4 segments between this LVA channel and the HVA CaV1.2 channel. The substitution of S4 segment of Domain II in CaV3.3 by that of CaV1.2 (chimera IIS4C) induced a ∼35 mV shift in the voltage-dependence of activation towards positive potentials, showing an I-V curve that almost overlaps with that of CaV1.2 channel. This HVA behavior induced by IIS4C chimera was accompanied by a 2-fold decrease in the voltage-dependence of channel gating. The IVS4 segment had also a strong effect in the voltage sensing of activation, while substitution of segments IS4 and IIIS4 moved the activation curve of CaV3.3 to more negative potentials. Swapping of IIS4 voltage sensor influenced additional properties of this channel such as steady-state inactivation, current decay, and deactivation. Notably, Domain I voltage sensor played a major role in preventing CaV3.3 channels to inactivate from closed states at extreme hyperpolarized potentials. Finally, site-directed mutagenesis in the CaV3.3 channel revealed a partial contribution of the S4-S5 linker of Domain II to LVA behavior, with synergic effects observed in double and triple mutations. These findings indicate that IIS4 and, to a lesser degree IVS4, voltage sensors are crucial in determining the LVA properties of CaV3.3 channels, although the accomplishment of this function involves the participation of other structural elements like S4-S5 linkers.},

To study this behaviour we have developed the first realistic computational model of the cuneothalamic projection neurons. The modelling was guided by experimental recordings, which suggest the existence of hyperpolarization-activated inward currents, transient low- and high-threshold calcium currents, and calcium-activated potassium currents. The neuronal responses were simulated during (1) sleep, (2) transition from sleep to wakefulness and (3) wakefulness under both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input. In wakefulness the model predicts a set of synaptically driven firing modes that could be associated with information processing strategies in the middle cuneate nucleus.},

In lateral pyloric (LP) neurons, we saw strong correlations between measured current and the abundance of Shal and BK-KCa mRNAs (encoding the Shal-family voltage-gated potassium channel and large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel, respectively). We also saw two- to fourfold interanimal variability for three potassium currents and their mRNA expression.

In contrast to asymptomatic, symptomatic subjects (1) displayed less percentage of wakefulness EEG pattern and more non-REM sleep, (2) showed higher beta and less delta EEG power in frontal cortex during non-REM sleep. Mid-frequency oscillations, such as sleep spindles and 5-9 Hz oscillations, were detected in EEG automatically and underwent time-frequency analysis by means of skeletons of wavelet surfaces. Some mid-frequency oscillations showed "complex" frequency structure, consisting of the dominant and subdominant components. "Complex" sleep spindles more frequently appeared in asymptomatic rats than in symptomatic, whereas the dominant frequency of these spindles in symptomatic rats was higher than in asymptomatic (12.7 vs 11.9.

We measured responses during both tonic and burst firing modes to sinusoidal current injection and performed Fourier analysis on these responses. For comparison, we constructed a minimal 'integrate-and-tire-or-burst' (IFB) neuron model that reproduces salient features of the relay cell responses. The IFB model is constrained to quantitatively fit our Fourier analysis of experimental relay neuron responses, including: the temporal tuning of the response in both tonic and burst modes, including a finding of low-pass and sometimes broadband behavior of tonic firing and band-pass characteristics during bursting, and the generally greater linearity of tonic compared with burst responses at low frequencies. In tonic mode, both experimental and theoretical responses display a frequency-dependent transition from massively superharmonic spiking to phase-locked superharmonic spiking near 3 Hz, followed by phase-locked subharmonic spiking at higher frequencies. Subharmonic and superharmonic burst responses also were observed experimentally. Characterizing the response properties of the 'tuned' IFB model leads to insights regarding the observed stimulus dependence of burst versus tonic response mode in relay neurons. Furthermore the simplicity of the IFB model makes it a candidate for large scale network simulations of thalamic functioning.},

	abstract = {In a systematic study of thalamocortical relay neuron responses to sinusoidal current injection [J. Neurophysiol. 83 (1), 588], we found that the Fourier fundamental of tonic responses was regularly phase advanced during low temporal frequency stimulation (1/10 cycle at 0.1 Hz). We hypothesized that such phase advances of the Fourier fundamental response were due to a slow spike-frequency adaptation. Here we measure the time-dependence of the instantaneous firing rate during a current pulse protocol, confirm the presence of a slow spike-frequency adaptation, and quantify the adaptation time constant (0.6-2.0 s) and percentage adaptation of spike rate (40-60\%). In light of these results, we augment a previously reported minimal integrate-and-fire-or-burst (IFB) neuron model with an adaptation current. When the parameters for this current are fit using a quantitative theory of spike-frequency adaptation [J. Neurophysiol. 79, 1549], the IFB model reproduces the experimentally observed phase advance of the Fourier fundamental response during sinusoidal current injection. Using fast-slow variable analysis, we develop a firing-rate reduction of the IFB model and perform parameter studies to investigate the dependence of the Fourier fundamental response (amplitude and phase) on the maximum conductance and recovery time constant for the adaptation current. Analytical calculations clarify the relationship between dc and ac measures of the suppression of response due to spike-frequency adaptation, show how the latter depends on stimulation frequency, and confirm the adaptation-induced phase advance of the Fourier fundamental observed in both experiment and simulation. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This is because spike cancellation produced by an inhibitory input requires coincidence in time, whereas an excitatory input can add spikes with less temporal constraint. To test for such potential differences, especially in the context of the function of thalamocortical (TC) relay nuclei, we used a stochastic "integrate-and-fire-or-burst" TC neuron model to quantify the detectability of excitatory and inhibitory drive in the presence and absence of the low-threshold Ca2+ current, IT, and the hyperpolarization-activated cation conductance, Isag. We find that excitatory inputs are generally superior drivers compared with inhibitory inputs in part because spontaneous activity of a postsynaptic neuron is not required in the case of excitatory drive. Interestingly, the presence of the low-threshold Ca2+ current, IT in a postsynaptic neuron allows the robust detection of inhibitory drive over a certain range of spontaneous and driven activity, a range that can be extended by the presence of the hyperpolarization-activated cation conductance, Isag. These simulations suggest a possible reinterpretation of the role of inhibitory inputs, such as those to the thalamus.},

	abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) and lesioning are two surgical techniques used in the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) in patients whose symptoms are not well controlled by drugs, or who experience dyskinesias as a side effect of medications. Although these treatments have been widely practiced, the mechanisms behind DBS and lesioning are still not well understood. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) are two common targets for both DBS and lesioning. Previous studies have indicated that DBS not only affects local cells within the target, but also passing axons within neighboring regions. Using a computational model of the basal gangliathalamic network, we studied the relative contributions of activation and silencing of local cells (LCs) and fibers of passage (FOPs) to changes in the accuracy of information transmission through the thalamus (thalamic fidelity), which is correlated with the effectiveness of DBS. Activation of both LCs and FOPs during STN and GPi-DBS were beneficial to the outcome of stimulation. During STN and GPi lesioning, effects of silencing LCs and FOPs were different between the two types of lesioning. For STN lesioning, silencing GPi FOPs mainly contributed to its effectiveness, while silencing only STN LCs did not improve thalamic fidelity. In contrast, silencing both GPi LCs and GPe FOPs during GPi lesioning contributed to improvements in thalamic fidelity. Thus, two distinct mechanisms produced comparable improvements in thalamic function: driving the output of the basal ganglia to produce tonic inhibition and silencing the output of the basal ganglia to produce tonic disinhibition. These results show the importance of considering effects of activating or silencing fibers passing close to the nucleus when deciding upon a target location for DBS or lesioning. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

	abstract = {Hebbian models of development and learning require both activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and a mechanism that induces competition between different synapses. One form of experimentally observed long-term synaptic plasticity, which we call spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), depends on the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials. In modeling studies, we find that this form of synaptic modification can automatically balance synaptic strengths to make postsynaptic firing irregular but more sensitive to presynaptic spike timing. It has been argued that neurons in vivo operate in such a balanced regime. Synapses modifiable by STDP compete for control of the timing of postsynaptic action potentials. Inputs that fire the postsynaptic neuron with short latency or that act in correlated groups are able to compete most successfully and develop strong synapses, while synapses of longer-latency or less-effective inputs are weakened.},

We examined this relationship using the phase resetting curve (PRC), which summarizes the change in the cycle period of a neuronal oscillator as a function of the input's timing within the oscillation. We first utilized a large database of single-compartment model neurons to determine the effect of individual membrane conductances on PRC shape; we found that the effects vary across conductance space, but on average, the hyperpolarization-activated and leak conductances advance the PRC. We next investigated how membrane conductances affect PRCs of the isolated pacemaker kernel in the pyloric circuit of Cancer borealis by: (1) tabulating PRCs while using dynamic clamp to artificially add varying levels of specific conductances, and (2) tabulating PRCs before and after blocking the endogenous hyperpolarization-activated current. We additionally used a previously described four-compartment model to determine how the location of the hyperpolarization-activated conductance influences that current's effect on the PRC. We report that while dynamic-clamp-injected leak current has much smaller effects on the PRC than suggested by the single-compartment model, an increase in the hyperpolarization-activated conductance both advances and reduces the noisiness of the PRC in the pacemaker kernel of the pyloric circuit in both modeling and experimental studies.},

	abstract = {In recent experiments, synaptically isolated neurons from rat cortical culture, were stimulated with periodic extra-cellular fixed-amplitude current pulses for extended durations of days. The neuron's response depended on its own history, as well as on the history of the input, and was classified into several modes. Interestingly, in one of the modes the neuron behaved intermittently, exhibiting irregular firing patterns changing in a complex and variable manner over the entire range of experimental timescales, from seconds to days. With the aim of developing a minimal biophysical explanation for these results, we propose a general scheme, that, given a few assumptions (mainly, a timescale separation in kinetics) closely describes the response of deterministic conductance-based neuron models under pulse stimulation, using a discrete time piecewise linear mapping, which is amenable to detailed mathematical analysis. Using this method we reproduce the basic modes exhibited by the neuron experimentally, as well as the mean response in each mode. Specifically, we derive precise closed- form input-output expressions for the transient timescale and firing rates, which are expressed in terms of experimentally measurable variables, and conform with the experimental results. However, the mathematical analysis shows that the resulting firing patterns in these deterministic models are always regular and repeatable (i.e., no chaos), in contrast to the irregular and variable behavior displayed by the neuron in certain regimes. This fact, and the sensitive near-threshold dynamics of the model, indicate that intrinsic ion channel noise has a significant impact on the neuronal response, and may help reproduce the experimentally observed variability, as we also demonstrate numerically. In a companion paper, we extend our analysis to stochastic conductance-based models, and show how these can be used to reproduce the details of the observed irregular and variable neuronal response. © 2012 Soudry and Meir.},

Intracellular recordings from thalamic and related cortical neurons in vivo demonstrate that, during natural slow-wave sleep oscillations or their experimental models, both thalamic and cortical neurons progressively enhance their responsiveness. This potentiation lasts for several minutes after the end of oscillatory periods. Cortical neurons display self-sustained activity, similar to responses evoked during previous epochs of stimulation, despite the fact that thalamic neurons remain under a powerful hyperpolarizing pressure. These data suggest that, far from being a quiescent state during which the cortex and subcortical structures are globally inhibited, slow-wave sleep may consolidate memory traces acquired during wakefulness in corticothalamic networks. Similar phenomena occur as a consequence of fast oscillations during brain-activated states.},

In this first intracellular study of neocortical activities during waking and sleep states, we hypothesized that synaptic activities during natural states of vigilance have a decisive impact on the observed electrophysiological properties of neurons that were previously studied under anesthesia or in brain slices. We investigated the incidence of different firing patterns in neocortical neurons of awake cats, the relation between membrane potential fluctuations and firing rates, and the input resistance during all states of vigilance. In awake animals, the neurons displaying fast-spiking firing patterns were more numerous, whereas the incidence of neurons with intrinsically bursting patterns was much lower than in our previous experiments conducted on the intact-cortex or isolated cortical slabs of anesthetized cats. Although cortical neurons displayed prolonged hyperpolarizing phases during slow-wave sleep, the firing rates during the depolarizing phases of the slow sleep oscillation was as high during these epochs as during waking and rapid-eye-movement sleep. Maximum firing rates, exceeding those of regular-spiking neurons, were reached by conventional fast-spiking neurons during both waking and sleep states, and by fast-rhythmic-bursting neurons during waking. The input resistance was more stable and it increased during quiet wakefulness, compared with sleep states. As waking is associated with high synaptic activity, we explain this result by a higher release of activating neuromodulators, which produce an increase in the input resistance of cortical neurons. In view of the high firing rates in the functionally disconnected state of slow-wave sleep, we suggest that neocortical neurons are engaged in processing internally generated signals.},

	abstract = {Stopping an initiated response could be implemented by a fronto-basal-ganglia circuit, including the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Intracranial recording studies in humans reveal an increase in beta-band power (∼ 16 -20 Hz) within the rIFC and STN when a response is stopped. This suggests that the beta-band could be important for communication in this network. If this is the case, then altering one region should affect the electrophysiological response at the other. We addressed this hypothesis by recording scalp EEG during a stop task while modulating STN activity with deep brain stimulation. We studied 15 human patients with Parkinson's disease and 15 matched healthy control subjects. Behaviorally, patients OFF stimulation were slower than controls to stop their response. Moreover, stopping speed was improved for ON compared to OFF stimulation. For scalp EEG, there was greater beta power, around the time of stopping, for patients ON compared to OFF stimulation. This effect was stronger over the right compared to left frontal cortex, consistent with the putative right lateralization of the stopping network. Thus, deep brain stimulation of the STN improved behavioral stopping performance and increased the beta-band response over the right frontal cortex. These results complement other evidence for a structurally connected functional circuit between right frontal cortex and the basal ganglia. The results also suggest that deep brain stimulation of the STN may improve task performance by increasing the fidelity of information transfer within a fronto-basal-ganglia circuit. © 2011 the authors.},

Using in situ hybridization, we have localized central and peripheral nervous system expression of three transcripts (α1G, α1H, and α1I) of the T-type calcium channel family (Ca(v)T). Each mRNA demonstrated a unique distribution, and expression of the three genes was largely complementary. We found high levels of expression of these transcripts in regions associated with prominent T-type currents, including inferior olivary and thalamic relay neurons (which expressed α1G), sensory ganglia, pituitary, and dentate gyrus granule neurons (α1H), and thalamic reticular neurons (α1I and α1H). Other regions of high expression included the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the claustrum (α1G), the olfactory tubercles (α1H and α1I), and the subthalamic nucleus (α1I and α1G). Some neurons expressed high levels of all three genes, including hippocampal pyramidal neurons and olfactory granule cells. Many brain regions showed a predominance of labeling for α1G, including the amygdala, cerebral cortex, rostral hypothalamus, brainstem, and spinal cord. Exceptions included the basal ganglia, which showed more prominent labeling for α1H and α1I, and the olfactory bulb, the hippocampus, and the caudal hypothalamus, which showed more even levels of all three transcripts. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that differential gene expression underlies pharmacological and physiological heterogeneity observed in neuronal T-type calcium currents, and they provide a molecular basis for the study of T-type channels in particular neurons.},

	abstract = {Most neurons have large numbers of voltage-and time-dependent currents that contribute to their electrical firing patterns. Because these currents are nonlinear, it can be difficult to determine the role each current plays in determining how a neuron fires. The lateral pyloric (LP) neuron of the stomatogastric ganglion of decapod crustaceans has been studied extensively biophysically. We constructed ∼600,000 versions of a four-compartment model of the LP neuron and distributed 11 different currents into the compartments. From these, we selected ∼1300 models that match well the electrophysiological properties of the biological neuron. Interestingly, correlations that were seen in the expression of channel mRNA in biological studies were not found across the ∼1300 admissible LP neuron models, suggesting that the electrical phenotype does not require these correlations. We used cubic fits of the function from maximal conductances to a series of electrophysiological properties to ask which conductances predominantly influence input conductance, resting membrane potential, resting spike rate, phasing of activity in response to rhythmic inhibition, and several other properties. In all cases, multiple conductances contribute to the measured property, and the combinations of currents that strongly influence each property differ. These methods can be used to understand how multiple currents in any candidate neuron interact to determine the cell's electrophysiological behavior. Copyright © 2009 Society for Neuroscience.},

	abstract = {Neuronal identity depends on the regulated expression of numerous molecular components, especially ionic channels, which determine the electrical signature of a neuron. Such regulation depends on at least two key factors, activity itself and neuromodulatory input. Neuronal electrical activity can modify the expression of ionic currents in homeostatic or nonhomeostatic fashion. Neuromodulators typically modify activity by regulating the properties or expression levels of subsets of ionic channels. In the stomatogastric system of crustaceans, both types of regulation have been demonstrated. Furthermore, the regulation of the coordinated expression of ionic currents and the channels that carry these currents has been recently reported in diverse neuronal systems, with neuromodulators not only controlling the absolute levels of ionic current expression but also, over long periods of time, appearing to modify their correlated expression. We hypothesize that neuromodulators may regulate the correlated expression of ion channels at multiple levels and in a cell-type-dependent fashion. We report that in two identified neuronal types, three ionic currents are linearly correlated in a pairwise manner, suggesting their coexpression or direct interactions, under normal neuromodulatory conditions. In each cell, some currents remain correlated after neuromodulatory input is removed, whereas the correlations between the other pairs are either lost or altered. Interestingly, in each cell, a different suite of currents change their correlation. At the transcript level we observe distinct alterations in correlations between channel mRNA amounts, including one of the cell types lacking a correlation under normal neuromodulatory conditions and then gaining the correlation when neuromodulators are removed. Synaptic activity does not appear to contribute, with one possible exception, to the correlated expression of either ionic currents or of the transcripts that code for the respective channels. We conclude that neuromodulators regulate the correlated expression of ion channels at both the transcript and the protein levels. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.},

Computer simulations and analysis of this model illuminate the roles of the coupling architecture of the network, and associated synaptic conductances, in modulating the activity patterns displayed by this network. Depending on the relationships of these coupling parameters, the network can support three general classes of sustained firing patterns: clustering, propagating waves, and repetitive spiking that may show little regularity or correlation. Each activity pattern can occur continuously or in discrete episodes. We characterize the mechanisms underlying these rhythms, as well as the influence of parameters on details such as spiking frequency and wave speed. These results suggest that the subthalamopallidal circuit is capable both of correlated rhythmic activity and of irregular autonomous patterns of activity that block rhythmicity. Increased striatal input to, and weakened intrapallidal inhibition within, the indirect pathway can switch the behavior of the circuit from irregular to rhythmic. This may be sufficient to explain the emergence of correlated oscillatory activity in the subthalamopallidal circuit after destruction of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson\&\#039;s disease and in animal models of parkinsonism.},

	abstract = {Our current understanding of the basal ganglia has facilitated the creation of computational models that have contributed novel theories, explored new functional anatomy and demonstrated results complementing physiological experiments. However, the utility of these models extends beyond these applications. Particularly in neuromorphic engineering, where the basal ganglia's role in computation is important for applications such as power efficient autonomous agents and model-based control strategies. The neurons used in existing computational models of the basal ganglia however, are not amenable for many low-power hardware implementations. Motivated by a need for more hardware accessible networks, we replicate four published models of the basal ganglia, spanning single neuron and small networks, replacing the more computationally expensive neuron models with an Izhikevich hybrid neuron. This begins with a network modeling action-selection, where the basal activity levels and the ability to appropriately select the most salient input is reproduced. A Parkinson's disease model is then explored under normal conditions, Parkinsonian conditions and during subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation. The resulting network is capable of replicating the loss of thalamic relay capabilities in the Parkinsonian state and its return under deep brain stimulation. This is also demonstrated using a network capable of action-selection. Finally, a study of correlation transfer under different patterns of Parkinsonian activity is presented. These networks successfully captured the significant results of the originals studies. This not only creates a foundation for neuromorphic hardware implementations but may also support the development of large-scale biophysical models.

	abstract = {Sleep is universal, tightly regulated, and its loss impairs cognition. But why does the brain need todisconnect from the environment for hours every day? The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY)proposes that sleep is the price the brain pays for plasticity. During a waking episode, learning statistical regularities about the current environment requires strengthening connections throughout thebrain. This increases cellular needs for energy and supplies, decreases signal-to-noise ratios, and saturates learning. During sleep, spontaneous activity renormalizes net synaptic strength and restores cellular homeostasis. Activity-dependent down-selection of synapses can also explain the benefits of sleep on memory acquisition, consolidation, and integration. This happens through the offline, comprehensive sampling of statistical regularities incorporated in neuronal circuits over a lifetime. This Perspective considers the rationale and evidence for SHY and points to open issues related to sleep and plasticity. What is the purpose of sleep?

According to the hypothesis, plastic processes occurring during wakefulness result in a net increase in synaptic strength in many brain circuits. The role of sleep is to downscale synaptic strength to a baseline level that is energetically sustainable, makes efficient use of gray matter space, and is beneficial for learning and memory. Thus, sleep is the price we have to pay for plasticity, and its goal is the homeostatic regulation of the total synaptic weight impinging on neurons.

	abstract = {To better understand population phenomena in thalamocortical neuronal ensembles, we have constructed a preliminary network model with 3,560 multicompartment neurons (containing soma, branching dendrites, and a portion of axon). Types of neurons included superficial pyramids (with regular spiking [RS] and fast rhythmic bursting [FRB] firing behaviors); RS spiny stellates; fast spiking (FS) interneurons, with basket-type and axoaxonic types of connectivity, and located in superficial and deep cortical layers; low threshold spiking (LTS) interneurons, which contacted principal cell dendrites; deep pyramids, which could have RS or intrinsic bursting (IB) firing behaviors, and endowed either with nontufted apical dendrites or with long tufted apical dendrites: thalamocortical relay (TCR) cells; and nucleus reticularis (nRT) cells. To the extent possible, both electrophysiology and synaptic connectivity were based on published data, although many arbitrary choices were necessary. In addition to synaptic connectivity (by AMPA/kainate, NMDA, and GABAA receptors), we also included electrical coupling between dendrites of interneurons, nRT cells, and TCR cells, and-in various combinations-electrical coupling between the proximal axons of certain cortical principal neurons. Our network model replicates several observed population phenomena, including 1) persistent gamma oscillations; 2) thalamocortical sleep spindles; 3) series of synchronized population bursts, resembling electrographic seizures; 4) isolated double population bursts with superimposed very fast oscillations ({\textbackslash}textgreater100 Hz, "VFO"); 5) spike-wave, polyspike-wave, and fast runs (about 10 Hz). We show that epileptiform bursts, including double and multiple bursts, containing VFO occur in rat auditory cortex in vitro, in the presence of kainate, when both GABAA and GABAB receptors are blocked. Electrical coupling between axons appears necessary (as reported previously) for persistent gamma and additionally plays a role in the detailed shaping of epileptogenic events. The degree of recurrent synaptic excitation between spiny stellate cells, and their tendency to fire throughout multiple bursts, also appears critical in shaping epileptogenic events.

	abstract = {Serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus, with their extensive innervation of limbic and higher brain regions and interactions with the endocrine system have important modulatory or regulatory effects on many cognitive, emotional and physiological processes. They have been strongly implicated in responses to stress and in the occurrence of major depressive disorder and other psychiatric disorders. In order to quantify some of these effects, detailed mathematical models of the activity of such cells are required which describe their complex neurochemistry and neurophysiology. We consider here a single-compartment model of these neurons which is capable of describing many of the known features of spike generation, particularly the slow rhythmic pacemaking activity often observed in these cells in a variety of species. Included in the model are 11 kinds of ion channels: a fast sodium current INa, a delayed rectifier potassium current IKDR, a transient potassium current IA, a slow non-inactivating potassium current IM, a low-threshold calcium current IT, two high threshold calcium currents IL and IN, small and large conductance potassium currents ISK and IBK, a hyperpolarization-activated cation current IH and a leak current ILeak. In Sections 3-8, each current type is considered in detail and parameters estimated from voltage clamp data where possible. Three kinds of model are considered for the BK current and two for the leak current. Intracellular calcium ion concentration Cai is an additional component and calcium dynamics along with buffering and pumping is discussed in Section 9. The remainder of the article contains descriptions of computed solutions which reveal both spontaneous and driven spiking with several parameter sets. Attention is focused on the properties usually associated with these neurons, particularly long duration of action potential, steep upslope on the leading edge of spikes, pacemaker-like spiking, long-lasting afterhyperpolarization and the ramp-like return to threshold after a spike. In some cases the membrane potential trajectories display doublets or have humps or notches as have been reported in some experimental studies. The computed time courses of IA and IT during the interspike interval support the generally held view of a competition between them in influencing the frequency of spiking. Spontaneous activity was facilitated by the presence of IH which has been found in these neurons by some investigators. For reasonable sets of parameters spike frequencies between about 0.6Hz and 1.2Hz are obtained, but frequencies as high as 6Hz could be obtained with special parameter choices. Topics investigated and compared with experiment include shoulders, notches, anodal break phenomena, the effects of noradrenergic input, frequency versus current curves, depolarization block, effects of cell size and the effects of IM. The inhibitory effects of activating 5-HT1A autoreceptors are also investigated. There is a considerable discussion of in vitro versus in vivo firing behavior, with focus on the roles of noradrenergic input, corticotropin-releasing factor and orexinergic inputs. Location of cells within the nucleus is probably a major factor, along with the state of the animal. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The subthalamic nucleus (STN) powerfully controls basal ganglia outputs and has been implicated in movement disorders observed in Parkinson's disease because of its pathological mixed burst firing mode and hyperactivity. A recent study suggested that reciprocally connected glutamatergic STN and GABAergic globus pallidus (GP) neurons act in vitro as a generator of bursting activity in basal ganglia. In vivo, we reported that GP neurons increased their firing rate in wakefulness (W) compared with slow-wave sleep (SWS) without any change in their random pattern. In contrast, STN neurons exhibited similar firing rates in W and SWS, with an irregular pattern in W and a bursty one in SWS. Thus, the pallidal GABAergic tone might control the STN pattern. This hypothesis was tested by mimicking such variations with microiontophoresis of GABA receptor ligands. GABA agonists specifically decreased the STN firing rate but did not affect its firing pattern. GABAA (but not GABAB) antagonists strongly enhanced the STN mean discharge rate during all vigilance states up to three to five times its basal activity. However, such applications did not change the typical W random pattern. When applied during SWS, GABAA antagonists strongly reinforced the spontaneous bursty pattern into a particularly marked one with instantaneous frequencies reaching 500-600 Hz. SWS-W transitions occurring during ongoing antagonist iontophoresis invariably disrupted the bursty pattern into a random one. Thus GABAA receptors play a critical, but not exclusive, role in regulating the excitatory STN influence on basal ganglia outputs.},

This article studies the modulation properties of the multiquadratic integrate-and-fire model, a generalization of the classical quadratic integrate-and-fire model. The model is shown to combine the computational economy of integrate-and-fire modeling and the physiological interpretability of conductance-based modeling.

Different types of brain rhythms arise during sleep and vary between layers, areas, or from one functional system to another. Local heterogeneity of such activities, here referred to as local sleep, overturns fundamental tenets of sleep as a globally regulated state. However, little is still known about the neuronal circuits involved and how they can generate their own specifically-tuned sleep patterns. NREM sleep patterns emerge in the brain from interplay of activity between thalamic and cortical networks. Within this fundamental circuitry, it now turns out that the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) acts as a key player in local sleep control. This is based on a marked heterogeneity of the TRN in terms of its cellular and synaptic architecture, which leads to a regional diversity of NREM sleep hallmarks, such as sleep spindles, delta waves and slow oscillations. This provides first evidence for a subcortical circuit as a determinant of cortical local sleep features. Here, we review novel cellular and functional insights supporting TRN heterogeneity and how these elements come together to account for local NREM sleep. We also discuss open questions arising from these studies, focusing on mechanisms of sleep regulation and the role of local sleep in brain plasticity and cognitive functions.},

In this paper, we take inspiration from cellular neuromodulation to construct a new deep neural network architecture that is specifically designed to learn adaptive behaviours. The network adaptation capabilities are tested on navigation benchmarks in a meta-reinforcement learning context and compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Results show that neuromodulation is capable of adapting an agent to different tasks and that neuromodulation-based approaches provide a promising way of improving adaptation of artificial systems.},

	abstract = {We discuss several lines of evidence refuting the hypothesis that procedural or declarative memories are processed/consolidated in sleep. One of the strongest arguments against a role for sleep in declarative memory involves the demonstration that the marked suppression or elimination of REM sleep in subjects on antidepressant drugs or with brainstem lesions produces no detrimental effects on cognition. Procedural memory, like declarative memory, undergoes a slow, time-dependent period of consolidation. A process has recently been described wherein performance on some procedural tasks improves with the mere passage of time and has been termed "enhancement." Some studies, but not others, have reported that the consolidation/enhancement of perceptual and motor skills is dependent on sleep. We suggest that consolidation or enhancement, initiated in waking with task acquisition, could in some instances extend to sleep, but sleep would serve no unique role in these processes. In sum, there is no compelling evidence to support a relationship between sleep and memory consolidation.},

The full model includes a model for a specialized class of high-threshold thalamocortical cells (HTC cells), which burst at the alpha frequency at depolarized membrane potentials (∼-56 mV). Our model generates alpha activity when the actions of either muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) or metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) agonists on thalamic reticular (RE), thalamocortical (TC), and HTC cells are mimicked. In our model of mGluR1-induced alpha, TC cells are equally likely to fire during any phase of alpha, consistent with in vitro experiments. By contrast, in our model of mAChR-induced alpha, TC cells tend to fire either at the peak or the trough of alpha, depending on conditions. Our modeling suggests that low levels of mGluR1 activation on a background of mAChR agonists may be able to initiate alpha activity that biases TC cells to fire at certain phases of alpha, offering a pathway for cortical control. If we introduce a strong stimulus by increasing the frequency of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) to TC cells, an increase in alpha power is needed to mimic the level of phasing of TC cells observed in vivo. This increased alpha power reduces the probability that TC cells spike near the trough of alpha. We suggest that mAChR-induced alpha may contribute to grouping TC activity into discrete perceptual units for processing, whereas mGluR1-induced alpha may serve the purpose of blocking unwanted stimuli fromreaching the cortex.},

With moderate change of membrane parameter values, the model neuron can exhibit both the spindle and delta rhythms, at different levels of hyperpolarization; only the slower (delta) one or none. In the case when the model neuron is not intrinsically oscillatory, its response to rhythmic hyperpolarization is complex, and displays the "intermittent phase-locking" phenomenon where bursts of Na+ action potentials occur infrequently but their occurrence is phase-locked to the rhythmic input. The rhythmic bursting, whenever possible, is shown to emerge (bifurcate) from a subthreshold oscillation. Near the bifurcation chaotic discharge patterns are observed, where spikes occur intermittently at randomly chosen cycles of a mostly subthreshold slow oscillation. Furthermore, when both the spindle and delta modes can be realized, the transition between the two appears as a sudden drop of the rhythmic frequency with increased hyperpolarization. The T-type calcium current and the sag current may explain the "intermittent phase-locking" phenomenon that is characteristic to thalamic relay neurons during spindle oscillation and provide a cellular basis for the 7-14 Hz rhythm and the slower 0.5-4 Hz rhythm. © 1994.},

The T-type Ca2+ current is described according to the Hodgkin-Huxley scheme, using the m3h format, with rate constants determined from the experimental data (22-24°C; extracellular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+](o) = 3 mM). The T-type Ca2+ current inactivates rapidly during maintained depolarization (time constant, τ(h) ≃ 20 ms at -20 mV), yet recovery from inactivation is slow (time constant, τ(r) ≃ 270 ms at -80 mV). To reconcile these observations, a two-step kinetic scheme is proposed for the inactivation gate. Each of the time constants in this scheme is voltage dependent, with a maximum at about -85 mV (45 ms for one and 275 ms for the other). Numerical simulations of recovery in a two-pulse, voltage-clamp protocol compare favorably with experimental results obtained by Coulter et al. as well as those obtained in an independent series of experiments with guinea pig thalamic neurons ([Ca2+](o) = 10 mM).

Outward currents are not required to reproduce the basic shape of the LTS. The LTS can be activated with either a depolarizing current step from a sufficiently hyperpolarized level or on termination of a hyperpolarizing current step. In either case, the amplitude of the LTS is a monotonically increasing, sigmoid-shaped function of the hyperpolarizing current step intensity. Because of the slower kinetic step of the channel's inactivation gate, our model predicts that recovery of the LTS to greater than one-half amplitude would require a prolonged hyperpolarization of {\textbackslash}textgreater100 ms (at body temperature). This imposes an upper limit (≃10 Hz) on the frequency of repetitive hyperpolarizations that can elicit a train of LTSs and hence on the frequency of any rhythm that requires LTS-mediated bursting of thalamic neurons.

To explore potential nucleus-specific burst features, we compared the membrane properties of dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and pulvinar nucleus relay neurons using in vitro whole-cell recording in juvenile and adult tree shrew (Tupaia) tissue slices. We injected current ramps of variable slope into neurons that were sufficiently hyperpolarized to de-inactivate T-type calcium channels. In a small percentage of juvenile pulvinar and dLGN neurons, an LTS could not be evoked. In the remaining juvenile neurons and in all adult dLGN neurons, a single LTS could be evoked by current ramps. However, in the adult pulvinar, current ramps evoked multiple LTSs in {\textbackslash}textgreater70\% of recorded neurons. Using immunohistochemistry, Western blot techniques, unbiased stereology, and confocal and electron microscopy, we found that pulvinar neurons expressed more T-type calcium channels (Ca v 3.2) and more small conductance potassium channels (SK2) than dLGN neurons and that the pulvinar nucleus contained a higher glia-to-neuron ratio than the dLGN. Hodgkin-Huxley-type compartmental models revealed that the distinct firing modes could be replicated by manipulating T-type calcium and SK2 channel density, distribution, and kinetics.

	abstract = {Thalamic neurons can exhibit two distinct firing modes: tonic and burst. In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the tonic mode appears as a relatively faithful relay of visual information from retina to cortex. The function of the burst mode is less understood. Its prevalence during slow-wave sleep (SWS) and linkage to synchronous cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) suggest that it has an important role during this form of sleep. Although not nearly as common, bursting can also occur during wakefulness. The goal of this study was to identify conditions that affect burst probability, and to compare burst incidence during sleeping and waking. LGN neurons are extraordinarily heterogenous in the degree to which they burst, during both sleeping and waking. Some LGN neurons never burst under any conditions during wakefulness, and several never burst during slow-wave sleep. During wakefulness, {\textbackslash}textless1\% of action potentials were associated with bursting, whereas during sleep this fraction jumps to 18\%. Although bursting was most common during slow-wave sleep, more than 50\% of the bursting originated from 14\% of the LGN cells. Bursting during sleep was largely restricted to episodes lasting 1-5 s, with ∼47\% of these episodes being rhythmic and in the delta frequency range (0.5-4 Hz). In wakefulness, although visual stimulation accounted for the greatest number of bursts, it was still a small fraction of the total response (4\%, 742 bursts/17,744 cycles in 93 cells). We identified two variables that appeared to influence burst probability: size of the visual stimuli used to elicit responses and behavioral state. Increased stimulus size increased burst probability. We attribute this to the increased influence large stimuli have on a cell's inhibitory mechanisms. As with sleep, a large fraction of bursting originated from a small number of cells. During visual stimulation, 50\% of bursting was generated by 9\% of neurons. Increased vigilance was negatively correlated with burst probability. Visual stimuli presented during active fixation (i.e., when the animal must fixate on an overt fixation point) were less likely to produce bursting, than when the same visual stimuli were presented but no fixation point present ("passive" fixation). Such observations suggest that even brief departures from attentive states can hyperpolarize neurons sufficiently to de-inactivate the burst mechanism. Our results provide a new view of the temporal structure of bursting during slow-wave sleep: one that supports episodic rhythmic activity in the intact animal. In addition, because bursting could be tied to specific conditions within wakefulness, we suggest that bursting has a specific function within that state.},

	abstract = {The influence of cortical feedback on thalamic visual responses has been a source of much discussion in recent years. In this study we examine the possible role of cortical feedback in shaping the spatiotemporal receptive field (STRF) responses of thalamocortical (TC) cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus. A population-based computational model of the thalamocortical network is used to generate a representation of the STRF response of LGN TC cells within the corticothalamic feedback circuit. The cortical feedback is shown to have little influence on the spatial response properties of the STRF organization. However, the model suggests that cortical feedback may play a key role in modifying the experimentally observed biphasic temporal response property of the STRF, that is, the reversal over time of the polarity of ON and OFF responses of the centre and surround of the receptive field, in particular accounting for the experimentally observed mismatch between retinal cells and TC cells in respect of the magnitude of the second (rebound) phase of the temporal response. The model results also show that this mismatch may result from an anti-phase corticothalamic feedback mechanism. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Complex multicellular organisms require rapid and accurate transmission of information among cells and tissues and tight coordination of distant functions. In vertebrates, electrical signals and the resulting intracel- lular calcium transients control contraction of muscle, secretion of hormones, sensation of the environment, processing of information in the brain, and output from the brain to peripheral tissues. In nonexcitable cells, calcium transients signal many key cellular events, in- cluding secretion, gene expression, and cell division. In epithelial cells, huge ion fluxes are conducted across tissue boundaries. All of these physiological processes are mediated in part by members of the voltage-gated ion channel protein superfamily (Fig. 1) (Yu and Catter- all, 2004). This protein superfamily of more than 140 members is one of the largest groups of signal transduc- tion proteins, and many family members are the molec- ular targets for toxins and therapeutic agents. Here we review the molecular and evolutionary relationships among the families within the voltage-gated-like (VGL1) ion channel superfamily.},

LVAs differ in their localization and molecular, biophysical, and biochemical properties, but all conduct a transient calcium current in a variety of cells. T-type currents mediate a number of physiological functions in developing and mature cells, and are implicated in neural and cardiovascular diseases. Hampered by a lack of selective antagonists, characterization of T-type channels has come from recombinant channel studies and use of pharmacological and electrophysiological methods to isolate endogenous T-type currents. The surprising heterogeneity in T-type currents likely results from differences in LVA molecular composition, temporal and spatial localization, and association with modulatory molecules. A fundamental knowledge of LVA biochemical properties, including the molecular composition of endogenous LVAs and spatial and temporal characterization of protein expression, is necessary to elucidate mechanisms for regulation of expression and function in normal and diseased cells.},

While broadly projecting neuromodulatory systems acting through metabotropic pathways have long been appreciated to be critical for determining brain state, more recent investigations have revealed a prominent role for fast acting neurotransmitter pathways for temporally and spatially precise control of neural processing. Corticocortical and thalamocortical glutamatergic projections can rapidly and precisely control brain state by changing both the nature of ongoing activity and by controlling the gain and precision of neural responses.},

	abstract = {All thalamic relay cells display a voltage-dependent low-threshold Ca2+ spike that plays an important role in relay of information to cortex. We investigated activation properties of this spike in relay cells of the cat's lateral geniculate nucleus using the combined approach of current- clamp intracellular recording from thalamic slices and simulations with a reduced model based on voltage-clamp data. Our experimental data from 42 relay cells showed that the actual Ca2+ spike activates in a nearly all- or-none manner and in this regard is similar to the conventional Na+/K+ action potential except that its voltage dependency is more hyperpolarized and its kinetics are slower. When the cell's membrane potential was hyperpolarized sufficiently to deinactivate much of the low-threshold Ca2+ current (I(T)) underlying the Ca2+ spike, depolarizing current injections typically produced a purely ohmic response when subthreshold and a full- blown Ca2+ spike of nearly invariant amplitude when suprathreshold. The transition between the ohmic response and activated Ca2+ spikes was abrupt and reflected a difference in depolarizing inputs of {\textbackslash}textless1 mV. However, activation of a full-blown Ca2+ spike was preceded by a slower period of depolarization that was graded with the amplitude of current injection, and the full-blown Ca2+ spike activated when this slower depolarization reached a sufficient membrane potential, a quasithreshold. As a result, the latency of the evoked Ca2+ spike became less with stronger activating inputs because a stronger input produced a stronger depolarization that reached the critical membrane potential earlier. Although Ca2+ spikes were activated in a nearly all-or-none manner from a given holding potential, their actual amplitudes were related to these holding potentials, which, in turn, determined the level of I(T) deinactivation. Our simulations could reproduce all of the main experimental observations. They further suggest that the voltage-dependent K+ conductance underlying I(A), which is known to delay firing in many cells, does not seem to contribute to the variable latency seen in activation of Ca2+ spikes. Instead the simulations indicate that the activation of I(T) starts initially with a slow and graded depolarization until enough of the underling transient (or T) Ca2+ channels are recruited to produce a fast, 'autocatalytic' depolarization seen as the Ca2+ spike. This can produce variable latency dependent on the strength of the initial activation of T channels. The nearly all-or-none nature of Ca2+ spike activation suggests that when a burst of action potentials normally is evoked as a result of a Ca2+ spike and transmitted to cortex, this signal is largely invariant with the amplitude of the input activating the relay cell.},

During burst mode, both low-threshold (LT) and high-threshold (HT) calcium channels are activated, while in tonic mode, only the HT-type of calcium channel is activated. The calcium signals associated with each firing mode were investigated in rat thalamic slices using whole cell patch clamping and confocal calcium imaging. Action potentials were induced by direct current injection into thalamic relay cells loaded with a fluorescent calcium indicator. In both tonic and burst firing modes, large calcium signals were recorded throughout the soma and proximal dendrites. To map the distribution of the channels mediating these calcium fluxes, LT and HT currents were independently activated using specific voltage-clamp protocols. We focused on the proximal region of the cell (up to 50 μm from the soma) because it appeared to be well clamped. For a voltage pulse of a given size, the largest calcium signals were observed in the proximal dendrites with smaller signals occurring in the soma and nucleus. This was true for both LT and HT signals. Rapid imaging, using one-dimensional linescans, was used to more precisely localize the calcium influx. For both LT and HT channels, calcium influx occurred simultaneously throughout all imaged regions including the soma and proximal dendrites. The presence of sizable calcium signals in the dendrites, soma, and nucleus during both firing modes, and the presence of LT calcium channels in the proximal dendrite where sensory afferents synapse, have implications for both the electrical functioning of relay cells and the transmission of sensory information to cortex.},

	abstract = {We used whole-cell patch recording to study 102 local interneurons in the rat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in vitro. Input impedance with this technique (607.0 ± 222.4 M\$Ømega\$) was far larger than that measured with sharp electrode techniques, suggesting that interneurons may be more electrotonically compact than previously believed. Consistent and robust burst firing was observed in all interneurons when a slight depolarizing boost was given from a potential at, or slightly hyperpolarized from, resting membrane potential. These bursts had some similarities to the low-threshold spike described previously in other thalamic neuron types. The bursting responses were blocked by Ni+, suggesting that the low-threshold calcium current I(T), responsible for the low-threshold spike, was also involved in interneuron burst firing. Compared to the low-threshold spike of thalamocortical cells, however, the interneuron bursts were of relatively long duration and low intraburst frequency. The requirement for a depolarizing boost to elicit the burst is consistent with previous reports of a depolarizing shift of the I(T) activation curve of interneurons relative to thalamocortical cells, a finding we confirmed using voltage-clamp. Voltage- clamp study also revealed an additional long-lasting current that could be tentatively identified as the calcium activated non-selective cation current, I(CAN), based on reversal potential and on pharmacological characteristics. Computer simulation of the interneuron burst demonstrated that its particular morphology is likely due to the interaction of I(T) and I(CAN). In the slice, bursts could also be elicited by stimulation of the optic tract, suggesting that they may occur in response to natural stimulation. Synaptically triggered bursts were only partially blocked by Ni+, but could then be completely blocked by further addition of (±)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid. The existence of robust bursts in this cell type suggests an additional role for interneurons in sculpting sensory responses by feedforward inhibition of thalamocortical cells. The low-threshold spike is a mechanism whereby activity in a neuron is dependent on a prior lack of activity in that same neuron. Understanding of the low-threshold spike in the other major neuron types of the thalamus has brought many new insights into how thalamic oscillations might be involved in sleep and epilepsy. Our description of this phenomenon in the interneurons of the thalamus suggests that these network oscillations might be even more complicated than previously believed.},

In this review, the different subtypes of voltage-gated calcium channels are described and their physiologic roles and pharmacology are outlined. We describe the current uses of drugs interacting with the different calcium channel subtypes and subunits, as well as specific areas in which there is strong potential for future drug development. Current therapeutic agents include drugs targeting L-type CaV1.2 calcium channels, particularly 1,4-dihydropyridines, which are widely used in the treatment of hypertension. T-type (CaV3) channels are a target of ethosuximide, widely used in absence epilepsy. The auxiliary subunit a2d-1 is the therapeutic target of the gabapentinoid drugs, which are of value in certain epilepsies and chronic neuropathic pain. The limited use of intrathecal ziconotide, a peptide blocker of N-type (CaV2.2) calcium channels, as a treatment of intractable pain, gives an indication that these channels represent excellent drug targets for various pain conditions. We describe how selectivity for different subtypes of calcium channels (e.g., CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 L-type channels) may be achieved in the future by exploiting differences between channel isoforms in terms of sequence and biophysical properties, variation in splicing in different target tissues, and differences in the properties of the target tissues themselves in terms of membrane potential or firing frequency. Thus, use-dependent blockers of the different isoforms could selectively block calcium channels in particular pathologies, such as nociceptive neurons in pain states or in epileptic brain circuits. Of important future potential are selective CaV1.3 blockers for neuropsychiatric diseases, neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease, and resistant hypertension. In addition, selective or nonselective T-type channel blockers are considered potential therapeutic targets in epilepsy, pain, obesity, sleep, and anxiety. Use-dependent N-type calcium channel blockers are likely to be of therapeutic use in chronic pain conditions. Thus, more selective calcium channel blockers hold promise for therapeutic intervention.},

In this study, we have explored the effects of Zn2+ on recombinant T-type calcium channels (CaV3.1, CaV3.2 and CaV3.3). Using tsA-201 cells, we demonstrate that CaV3.2 current (IC50,0.8 μM) is significantly more sensitive to Zn2+ than are CaV3.1 and CaV3.3 currents (IC50, 80 μM and ∼ 160 μM, respectively). This inhibition of CaV3 currents is associated with a shift to more negative membrane potentials of both steady-state inactivation for CaV3.1, CaV3.2 and CaV3.3 and steady-state activation for CaV3.1 and CaV3.3 currents. We also document changes in kinetics, especially a significant slowing of the inactivation kinetics for CaV3.1 and CaV3.3, but not for CaV3.2 currents. Notably, deactivation kinetics are significantly slowed for CaV3.3 current (∼100-fold), but not for CaV3.1 and CaV 3.2 currents. Consequently, application of Zn2+; results in a significant increase in CaV3.3 current in action potential clamp experiments, while CaV3.1 and CaV3.2 currents are significantly reduced. In neuroblastoma NG 108-15 cells, the duration of CaV3.3-mediated action potentials is increased upon Zn2+; application, indicating further that Zn2+; behaves as a CaV3.3 channel opener. These results demonstrate that Zn2+; exhibits differential modulatory effects on T-type calcium channels, which may partly explain the complex features of Zn2+; modulation of the neuronal excitability in normal and disease states. © 2007 The Authors.

These channels are low voltage-activated calcium channels that play a key role in cellular excitability and various physiological functions. Their dysfunction has been linked to several neurological disorders, including absence epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Recent studies have revealed that T-type channels are modulated by a variety of serine/threonine protein kinase pathways, which indicates the need for a systematic analysis of T-type channel phosphorylation. Here, we immunopurified Cav3.2 channels from rat brain, and we used high-resolution MS to construct the first, to our knowledge, in vivo phosphorylation map of a voltage-gated calcium channel in a mammalian brain. We identified as many as 34 phosphorylation sites, and we show that the vast majority of these sites are also phosphorylated on the human Cav3.2 expressed in HEK293T cells. In patch-clamp studies, treatment of the channel with alkaline phosphatase as well as analysis of dephosphomimetic mutants revealed that phosphorylation regulates important functional properties of Cav3.2 channels, including voltage-dependent activation and inactivation and kinetics. We also identified that the phosphorylation of a locus situated in the loop I-II S442/S445/T446 is crucial for this regulation. Our data show that Cav3.2 channels are highly phosphorylated in the mammalian brain and establish phosphorylation as an important mechanism involved in the dynamic regulation of Cav3.2 channel gating properties.},

Few neuronal T-current regulations have been described so far, but interestingly some of them involve unusual mechanisms like G protein-independent but receptor-coupled modulation, while the use of recombinant channels has established both a direct action of Gbetagamma subunits, anandamide, arachidonic acid and a phosphorylation process by CaMKII. Nearly all reported types of modulation involve Cav3.2 channels while no regulation of Cav3.1 has been reported, a difference that may originate from diversities in the intracellular loop connecting the II and III domains of the two isotypes. The search for T-current regulators requires taking into account their peculiar activation properties, since a close link may exist between the channel conformation and its modulation. Indeed, in thalamocortical neurons a phosphorylation-mediated regulation of the amplitude of the T-current has been shown to be highly dependent upon the state of the channel and only to become apparent when the channels are in the voltage range close to neuronal resting membrane potential.},

	abstract = {Historically, after neurons and their fine dendrites and axons were visualized using the Golgi stain, it was debated whether the structure of the neuron was fixed or could change. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Ramon y Cajal proposed that the site of contact between individual neurons might change in response to experience. Cajal was correct, but these changes are not restricted to structural alterations; they also include functional changes in activity of these contacts. In the preceding chapters we have covered the details of how nerve terminals convert action potential activity into chemical neurotransmitter release that can be sensed by neighboring cells. Furthermore, we detailed how these neurotransmitter release events are sensed by postsynaptic partners (often at their dendritic spines) and how these postsynaptic neurons integrate this input to generate a decision to fire an action potential and communicate to the next neuron in the circuit. Importantly, neither synaptic communication between neurons, nor the structures (axons and dendrites) that mediate this communication are fixed; they can be modified based on different patterns of neuronal activity, the coincident action of multiple neurotransmitter receptors, and biochemical signals within cells. The ability of neurons to modify their synaptic communication is called synaptic plasticity.},

	abstract = {Artificial neural networks overwrite previously learned tasks when trained sequentially, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, the brain learns continuously, and typically learns best when new training is interleaved with periods of sleep for memory consolidation. Here we used spiking network to study mechanisms behind catastrophic forgetting and the role of sleep in preventing it. The network could be trained to learn a complex foraging task but exhibited catastrophic forgetting when trained sequentially on different tasks. In synaptic weight space, new task training moved the synaptic weight configuration away from the manifold representing old task leading to forgetting. Interleaving new task training with periods of off-line reactivation, mimicking biological sleep, mitigated catastrophic forgetting by constraining the network synaptic weight state to the  previously learned manifold, while allowing the weight configuration to converge towards the intersection of the manifolds representing old and new tasks. The study reveals a possible strategy of synaptic weights dynamics the brain applies during sleep to prevent forgetting and optimize learning.},

	abstract = {Neural firing patterns are critical for specific information coding and transmission, and abnormal firing is implicated in a series of neural pathologies. Recent studies have indicated that enhanced burst firing mediated by T-type voltage-gated calcium channels (T-VGCCs) in specific neuronal subtypes is involved in several mental or neurological disorders such as depression and epilepsy, while suppression of T-VGCCs relieve related symptoms. Burst firing consists of groups of relatively high-frequency spikes separated by quiescence. Neurons in a variety of brain areas, including the thalamus, hypothalamus, cortex, and hippocampus, display burst firing, but the ionic mechanisms that generating burst firing and the related physiological functions vary among regions. In this review, we summarize recent findings on the mechanisms underlying burst firing in various brain areas, as well as the roles of burst firing in several mental and neurological disorders. We also discuss the ion channels and receptors that may regulate burst firing directly or indirectly, with these molecules highlighted as potential intervention targets for the treatment of mental and neurological disorders.},

	abstract = {The neuronal networks that generate locomotion are well understood in swimming animals such as the lamprey, zebrafish and tadpole. The networks controlling locomotion in tetrapods remain, however, still enigmatic with an intricate motor pattern required for the control of the entire limb during the support, lift off, and flexion phase, and most demandingly when the limb makes contact with ground again. It is clear that the inhibition that occurs between bursts in each step cycle is produced by V2b and V1 interneurons, and that a deletion of these interneurons leads to synchronous flexor–extensor bursting. The ability to generate rhythmic bursting is distributed over all segments comprising part of the central pattern generator network (CPG). It is unclear how the rhythmic bursting is generated; however, Shox2, V2a and HB9 interneurons do contribute. To deduce a possible organization of the locomotor CPG, simulations have been elaborated. The motor pattern has been simulated in considerable detail with a network composed of unit burst generators; one for each group of close synergistic muscle groups at each joint. This unit burst generator model can reproduce the complex burst pattern with a constant flexion phase and a shortened extensor phase as the speed increases. Moreover, the unit burst generator model is versatile and can generate both forward and backward locomotion.},

	abstract = {Thalamic neurons have two firing modes: tonic and bursting.
 It was originally suggested that bursting occurs only during states
 such as slow-wave sleep, when little or no information is relayed by
 the thalamus. However, bursting occurs during wakefulness in the
 visual and somatosensory thalamus, and could theoretically influence
 sensory processing. Here we used chronically implanted electrodes to
 record from the ventroposterior medial thalamic nucleus (VPM) and
 primary somatosensory cortex (SI) of awake, freely moving rats during
 different behaviors. These behaviors included quiet immobility,
 exploratory whisking (large-amplitude whisker movements), and whisker
 twitching (small-amplitude, 7- to 12-Hz whisker movements). We
 demonstrated that thalamic bursting appeared during the oscillatory
 activity occurring before whisker twitching movements, and continued
 throughout the whisker twitching. Further, thalamic bursting occurred
 during whisker twitching substantially more often than during the other
 behaviors, and a neuron was most likely to respond to a stimulus if a
 burst occurred ≈120 ms before the stimulation. In addition, the
 amount of cortical area activated was similar to that during whisking.
 However, when SI was inactivated by muscimol infusion, whisker
 twitching was never observed. Finally, we used a statistical technique
 called partial directed coherence to identify the direction of
 influence of neural activity between VPM and SI, and observed that
 there was more directional coherence from SI to VPM during whisker
 twitching than during the other behaviors. Based on these findings, we
 propose that during whisker twitching, a descending signal from SI
 triggers thalamic bursting that primes the thalamocortical loop for
 enhanced signal detection during the whisker twitching behavior.},

            State-dependent thalamocortical activity is important for sensory coding, oscillations, and cognition. The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) relays visual information to the cortex, but the state-dependent spontaneous activity of LGN neurons in awake behaving animals remains controversial. Using a combination of pupillometry, extracellular, and intracellular recordings from identified LGN neurons in behaving mice, we show that thalamocortical (TC) neurons and interneurons are distinctly correlated to arousal forming two complementary coalitions. Intracellular recordings indicated that the membrane potential of LGN TC neurons was tightly correlated to fluctuations in pupil size. Inactivating the corticothalamic feedback to the LGN suppressed the arousal dependency of LGN neurons. Taken together, our results show that LGN neuronal membrane potential and action potential output are dynamically linked to arousal-dependent brain states in awake mice, and this might have important functional implications.},

	abstract = {Pain occurs in time. In naturalistic settings, pain perception is sometimes stable but often varies in intensity and quality over the course of seconds, minutes, and days. A principal aim in classic electrophysiology studies of pain was to uncover a neural code based on the temporal patterns of single neuron firing. In contrast, modern neuroimaging studies have placed emphasis on uncovering the spatial pattern of brain activity (or “map”) that may reflect the pain experience. However, in the emerging field of connectomics, communication within and among brain networks is characterized as intrinsically dynamic on multiple time scales. In this review, we revisit the single-cell electrophysiological evidence for a nociceptive neural code and consider how those findings relate to recent advances in understanding systems-level dynamic processes that suggest the existence of a “dynamic pain connectome” as a spatiotemporal physiological signature of pain. We explore how spontaneous activity fluctuations in this dynamic system shape, and are shaped by, acute and chronic pain experiences and individual differences in those experiences. Highlighting the temporal dimension of pain, we aim to move pain theory beyond the concept of a static neurosignature and toward an ethologically relevant account of naturalistic dynamics.},

              Different behavioral states of an animal are characterized by distinct patterns of global brain activity. For example, slow-wave sleep is associated with membrane potential transitions in cortical neurons and high-amplitude, low-frequency local field potential and electroencephalogram signals. In contrast, during rapid—eye-movement sleep and wakefulness, low-amplitude, high-frequency cortical activity dominates with neuronal membrane potentials fluctuating around a depolarized level.

            Different global patterns of brain activity are associated with distinct arousal and behavioral states of an animal, but how the brain rapidly switches between different states remains unclear. We here report that repetitive high-frequency burst spiking of a single rat cortical neuron could trigger a switch between the cortical states resembling slow-wave and rapid–eye-movement sleep. This is reflected in the switching of the membrane potential of the stimulated neuron from slow UP/DOWN oscillations to a persistent-UP state or vice versa, with concurrent changes in the temporal pattern of cortical local field potential (LFP) recorded several millimeters away. These results point to the power of single cortical neurons in modulating the behavioral state of an animal.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Dragonflies visually detect prey and conspecifics, rapidly pursuing these targets via acrobatic flights. Over many decades, studies have investigated the elaborate neuronal circuits proposed to underlie this rapid behaviour. A subset of dragonfly visual neurons exhibit exquisite tuning to small, moving targets even when presented in cluttered backgrounds. In prior work, these neuronal responses were quantified by computing the rate of spikes fired during an analysis window of interest. However, neuronal systems can utilize a variety of neuronal coding principles to signal information, so a spike train’s information content is not necessarily encapsulated by spike rate alone. One example of this is burst coding, where neurons fire rapid bursts of spikes, followed by a period of inactivity. Here we show that the most studied target-detecting neuron in dragonflies, CSTMD1, responds to moving targets with a series of spike bursts. This spiking activity differs from those in other identified visual neurons in the dragonfly, indicative of different physiological mechanisms underlying CSTMD1’s spike generation. Burst codes present several advantages and disadvantages compared to other coding approaches. We propose functional implications of CSTMD1’s burst coding activity and show that spike bursts enhance the robustness of target-evoked responses.},

              SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
              Ion channels are transmembrane proteins with selective permeability to specific charged particles. The rich repertoire of parameters that may gate their opening state, such as voltage-sensitivity, modulation by second messengers and specific kinetics, make this protein family a determinant of neuronal identity. Ion channel structure is evolutionary conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates, making any discovery easily translatable. Through a screen to uncover ion channels with roles in circadian rhythms, we have identified the I
              h
              channel as an important player in a subset of clock neurons of the fruit fly. We show that lateral ventral neurons (LNvs) need I
              h
              to fire action potentials in a high-frequency bursting mode and that this is important for peptide transport and the control of behavior.},

Here, we report divergence in stimulus-encoding properties between subpopulations of cortical neurons that are classified based on spike timing and waveform features. Neurons in auditory cortex of the awake marmoset (
              Callithrix jacchus
              ) encode temporal information with either stimulus-synchronized or nonsynchronized responses. When we classified single-unit recordings using either a criteria-based or an unsupervised classification method into regular-spiking, fast-spiking, and bursting units, a subset of intrinsically bursting neurons formed the most highly synchronized group, with strong phase-locking to sinusoidal amplitude modulation (SAM) that extended well above 20 Hz. In contrast with other unit types, these bursting neurons fired primarily on the rising phase of SAM or the onset of unmodulated stimuli, and preferred rapid stimulus onset rates. Such differentiating behavior has been previously reported in bursting neuron models and may reflect specializations for detection of acoustic edges. These units responded to natural stimuli (vocalizations) with brief and precise spiking at particular time points that could be decoded with high temporal stringency. Regular-spiking units better reflected the shape of slow modulations and responded more selectively to vocalizations with overall firing rate increases. Population decoding using time-binned neural activity found that decoding behavior differed substantially between regular-spiking and bursting units. A relatively small pool of bursting units was sufficient to identify the stimulus with high accuracy in a manner that relied on the temporal pattern of responses. These unit type differences may contribute to parallel and complementary neural codes.},

	abstract = {Rewarding Bursts of Dopamine
            
              Dopaminergic neurons are thought to be involved in the cognitive and hedonic underpinnings of motivated behaviors. However, it is still unclear whether dopaminergic neuron activation is sufficient to elicit reward-related behavior and which type of neuronal activity pattern serves this purpose.
              
                Tsai
                et al.
              
              (p. 1080; published online 23 April) directly compared tonic versus phasic firing of dopaminergic cells in the ventral tegmental area, and the effects on both behavior and dopamine release. Using a transgenic system and virus injection in mice, they targeted the dopaminergic cells with rhodopsin. Light stimulation was then used to drive dopaminergic cells either with a tonic low level of pulses or bursts of high-frequency pulses, with the number of pulses being equal across conditions. Only the high-frequency phasic firing induced a conditioned place preference and dopamine release.
            
          , 
            High-frequency pulses in deep brain cells release dopamine and cause reward-related behavior in mice.
          , 
            Natural rewards and drugs of abuse can alter dopamine signaling, and ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons are known to fire action potentials tonically or phasically under different behavioral conditions. However, without technology to control specific neurons with appropriate temporal precision in freely behaving mammals, the causal role of these action potential patterns in driving behavioral changes has been unclear. We used optogenetic tools to selectively stimulate VTA dopaminergic neuron action potential firing in freely behaving mammals. We found that phasic activation of these neurons was sufficient to drive behavioral conditioning and elicited dopamine transients with magnitudes not achieved by longer, lower-frequency spiking. These results demonstrate that phasic dopaminergic activity is sufficient to mediate mammalian behavioral conditioning.},

	abstract = {During development, neurons arrive at local brain areas in an extended period of time, but how they form local neural circuits is unknown. Here we computationally model the emergence of a network for precise timing in the premotor nucleus HVC in songbird. We show that new projection neurons, added to HVC post hatch at early stages of song development, are recruited to the end of a growing feedforward network. High spontaneous activity of the new neurons makes them the prime targets for recruitment in a self-organized process via synaptic plasticity. Once recruited, the new neurons fire readily at precise times, and they become mature. Neurons that are not recruited become silent and replaced by new immature neurons. Our model incorporates realistic HVC features such as interneurons, spatial distributions of neurons, and distributed axonal delays. The model predicts that the birth order of the projection neurons correlates with their burst timing during the song.},

              Structural plasticity of dendritic spines is thought to underlie memory formation. Size of a dendritic spine is considered proportional to the size of its postsynaptic density (PSD), number of glutamate receptors and synaptic strength. However, whether this correlation is true for all dendritic spine volumes, and remains stable during synaptic plasticity, is largely unknown. In this study, we take advantage of 3D electron microscopy and reconstruct dendritic spines and cores of PSDs from the
              stratum radiatum
              of the area CA1 of organotypic hippocampal slices. We observe that approximately 1/3 of dendritic spines, in a range of medium sizes, fail to reach significant correlation between dendritic spine volume and PSD surface area or PSD-core volume. During NMDA receptor-dependent chemical long-term potentiation (NMDAR-cLTP) dendritic spines and their PSD not only grow, but also PSD area and PSD-core volume to spine volume ratio is increased, and the correlation between the sizes of these two is tightened. Further analysis specified that only spines that contain smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) grow during cLTP, while PSD-cores grow irrespectively of the presence of SER in the spine. Dendritic spines with SER also show higher correlation of the volumetric parameters than spines without SER, and this correlation is further increased during cLTP only in the spines that contain SER. Overall, we found that correlation between PSD surface area and spine volume is not consistent across all spine volumes, is modified and tightened during synaptic plasticity and regulated by SER.},

            Effective treatments that prevent or reduce drug relapse vulnerability should be developed to relieve the high burden of drug addiction on society. This will only be possible by enhancing the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the neurobiology of addiction. Recent experimental data have shown that dendritic spines, small protrusions from the dendrites that receive excitatory input, of spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens exhibit morphological changes during drug exposure and withdrawal. Moreover, these changes relate to the characteristic drug-seeking behavior of addiction. However, due to the complexity of dendritic spines, we do not yet fully understand the processes underlying their structural changes in response to different inputs. We propose that biophysical models can enhance the current understanding of these processes by incorporating different, and sometimes, discrepant experimental data to identify the shared underlying mechanisms and generate experimentally testable hypotheses. This review aims to give an up-to-date report on biophysical models of dendritic spines, focusing on those models that describe their shape changes, which are well-known to relate to learning and memory. Moreover, it examines how these models can enhance our understanding of the effect of the drugs and the synaptic changes during withdrawal, as well as during neurodegenerative disease progression such as Alzheimer’s disease.},

            Systematically organizing the anatomical, molecular, and physiological properties of cortical neurons is important for understanding their computational functions. Hippocampome.org defines 122 neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation based on their somatic, axonal, and dendritic locations, putative excitatory/inhibitory outputs, molecular marker expression, and biophysical properties. We augmented the electrophysiological data of this knowledge base by collecting, quantifying, and analyzing the firing responses to depolarizing current injections for every hippocampal neuron type from published experiments. We designed and implemented objective protocols to classify firing patterns based on 5 transients (delay, adapting spiking, rapidly adapting spiking, transient stuttering, and transient slow-wave bursting) and 4 steady states (non-adapting spiking, persistent stuttering, persistent slow-wave bursting, and silence). This automated approach revealed 9 unique (plus one spurious) families of firing pattern phenotypes while distinguishing potential new neuronal subtypes. Novel statistical associations emerged between firing responses and other electrophysiological properties, morphological features, and molecular marker expression. The firing pattern parameters, experimental conditions, spike times, references to the original empirical evidences, and analysis scripts are released open-source through Hippocampome.org for all neuron types, greatly enhancing the existing search and browse capabilities. This information, collated online in human- and machine-accessible form, will help design and interpret both experiments and model simulations.},
